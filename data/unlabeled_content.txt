this is my best guess as to where to put this so if i should go elsewhere just let me know i am 18m a soccer fanatic and i have played since i was 4 years old i have always been very careful to take care of my legs they are very powerful relative to the rest of my body can squat 300lbs but weigh only 135lbs and are very agile i take pride in my legs this may be weird but i do whenever my legs become even slightly entrapped such as getting tangled in the straps on a backpack under my desk wrapped up in the sheets of my bed or even cramp in an area with little leg room such as a small desk or car i begin to feel panicked and nauseous any time that my legs begin to feel restricted it automatically makes the rest of me feel restricted and i feel awful would this be considered claustrophobia cleithrophobia or am i just overreacting
mild cleithrophobia possible

child anxiety panic attacks
this is my first time posting anything so thankful i found this thought i had say something about 2 years ago i started having major problems major panic attacks out of nowhere fine one moment utter terror and pain the next the worst of it would last several hours but even when the worst passed i could not find even the slightest bit of happiness for up to a month it really took a lot out of me little background i am a recovering alcolohic beyond that no major trauma or troubles in life i asked for help pretty much immediately i see a therapist regularly i have seen another therapist and i have discussed it with my primary care i have discussed with a lot of guys from aa most people do not seem to understand at all my wife thinks i am crazy and weak i have felt pretty much alone with this i have felt pretty good lately therapy has helped i think i have found the right meds low dose of zoloft but the darkness of it is always hovering it always seems to come out of nowhere being somewhere far from home will push me over the edge or other situations from which i cannot immediately extract myself sometimes thoughts of bad things i have done in the past nothing too bad trigger an overwhelming desire to confess i cannot take xanax or ativan because it makes me think i am going to die i take cholesterol medication and have to examine each pill before taking it to make sure it is not something else symptoms include shortness of breath also makes me think i am going to die tingly extremities nausea constantly having to use the bathroom headaches and of course the terror not sure what else to say like i said i have been feeling better some things that have definitely helped are therapy exercise hobbies working hard getting up really early and doing the right thing most importantly is the consistency of al of these things

hey guys new here just came over here from the anxiety subreddit because lucky me i have panic disorder and mild depersonalization derealization i am a 25 y o lady and i started having panic attacks and constant anxiety about a year ago a lot has changed in my life in the past year i m in a long distance relationship started down a new career path preparing for a move some family health issues and i feel like the stress of all of that has really converged into a shitstorm of anxiety i used to smoke occasionally and i thought it was triggered initially by a weird high that made me feel paranoid and anxious and out of body but i see now that it is a lot more complicated than that i am really sick of living in a state of anxiety and when my panic really sets in i feel like i am legitimately dying and that scares the crap out of me it is crazy and honestly sometimes so hard to believe that my chest pains and palpitations and nausea and dizziness are all being caused by my anxiety it does not seem rational the other day i had to leave work in the middle of my shift to go to urgent care because i was convinced that i was having a heart attack luckily though i am not alone and i am so glad that there is a little corner on the internet of people who feel like me and people who felt like me but got better i hope i can find support here and return the favor thanks
leaving my pity party for the panic party
i work at a hospital and today i had a bad panic attack i felt it coming as i always do the knee shaking feeling scared of nothing in particular and to me the official stamp of a panic attack the overwhelming feeling thoughts of i want to go home i need to leave o need to get out of here followed by a river of tears and hysterics and hyperventilating because i work in a hospital even though i called my friend coworker she had to notify employee health and i was told i needed to go to the emergency room so whatever blah blah blah i go and then they let me out and i go home early this is where i am wondering if this happens to everyone when i got home i was exhausted this has happened before when i have had panic attacks like this and i slept from 12 noon through 6pm and only woke up when my boyfriend got home now it is 730 i feel okay anxiety wise but i feel sooo achey does anyone else feel like this achey and exhausted after an anxiety attack what else do you feel like are your panic attacks like mine i need someone to relate to me tl dr had bad anxiety attack came home after and slept for 5 hours and now am achey wondering if that happens to everyone
panic attack took me to the er today need someone to relate and questions about after effects
first time poster here 19 year old male i have panic disorder and i get panic attacks anywhere from 2 5 times a day they are often started by social situations or places where i have previously had a panic attack in particular during a panic attack i think that if i am not with anyone i know then i am being followed by somebody or i am being recorded in some fashion and i am the centerpiece of a grand conspiracy if i am with a someone i know i feel like they are plotting and scheming with their other friends to try and get information out of me that they can later turn and use against me in some manner as to hurt me either by giving me a bad name or possibly fabricating a story about any information i may have told them to hinder me from getting a job or academically etc i am in the constant state of fear that i am being surveyed or that people i know are out to get me and that i can not trust anyone i do not have a fear of death unless the panic attack is bad today i was simply eating lunch with a friend one to one and i saw them fidgeting with their earbuds hanging it around their neck placing it to the side of them on the table and leaning to that side when they were talking i took this as them trying to record me they were asking prodding questions about stuff they never had any prior interest in like my goals for the semester my life and asking me things i knew they already knew i mentioned something i have repeated a million times and they got really loud and were trying to act surprised but to me it did not seem genuine the point is that almost any social situation can and probably has caused me to have a panic attack about it i know also almost for a fact that smoking not cigarettes has brought this about since the onset of these symptoms minor anxiety i have stopped smoking but the panic attacks increase in frequency and severity i have almost run out of options because it is causing me to not trust anyone and in turn it is eating away at all of my relationships i have talked to my parents about it and they know that it was my prior drug use that has brought about the symptoms but i do not think they fully understand that i am still having daily panic attacks but they are the most supportive people in my life how do i stop thinking that my friends have malicious intent it has gotten to the point that even after a panic attack i still have feelings that they should not be trusted i seriously do not know where to go from here and it is very scary i met with a therapist for the first time today but my next appointment is not until a week later and i am not sure i can hold my sanity until then as i am sure this weekend my friends will want to hang out

in the last few months i became very convinced that cortisol levels play a major role in anxiety panic attacks and depression i came to this conclusion through personal blood test results and the changing levels of anxiety through the day that are identical to the cortisol daily cycle starting at very high levels with 30 min of waking up and fluctuating during the day so here is a link to the drugs that i found that could help with lowering cortisol and had success in lowering anxiety depression levels i only selected the drugs that have been researched and my main source of information was us national library of medicine national institutes of health i collected the useful data in a word document which you can download at this link hope it will be useful to some and would like to hear your thoughts about it the difficult part is finding a doctor who has a good understanding in psychiatry and endocrinology and who would have an open mind to new ideas
effects of cortisol levels on anxiety and depression

how can i help my boyfriend
you lovely people may or may not remember me but i posted a while back about something or other i know what i am doing is not normal the response i got from you as a community helped me take that step to getting help first an update i am on medication it is helping heck i am even driving now i am doing things at work making mistakes and figuring out how to fix it instead of dreading the doom that will surely be visited on me my department has grown by a new member and i am looking into problems for them and the customer service team and i feel like i am handling it well or i feel like i look like i am handling it if that makes no sense the downside maybe my title gave it away i am terrified that everything is going so well that something must be going horribly wrong somewhere and i just have not noticed it yet i am on the waiting list for a psychiatrist but that is another story involving my manager making me cancel an appointment which in the nhs is like finding gold and i have not heard anything back from them since sighs still impostor syndrome or whatever i feel like i am just waiting for something to go wrong why i do not know to prove that little demon on my shoulder right let me know if this is the wrong subreddit guys 3 i do not want to be cluttering up things with posts in the wrong place
everything is going so well what is the catch
i go to a relatively large school in the midwest and now as i am about to begin my sophomore year my roommate wants me to go out to parties with him but i just can t i feel like some kind of freak because partying is what college is all about right he is fairly understanding about it but even when the subject of going out to parties is brought up my heart starts racing i feel a shot of adrenaline my stomach gets upset and i start sweating i am worried that by not going to parties i am missing out on a big part of being a young person when i do not go to parties i end up feeling awful about myself because i start to think about how we only have one life to live and i am not using my time to enjoy life along with not going to parties i have the problem of not being able to meet any friends at school because the main way of meeting friends is at parties if i cannot even manage to meet new friends how the hell am i going to meet a girl someday to marry as it is i have only ever had one girlfriend and i am a 19 year old virgin i guess the main point of what i am saying is that i am a young person who does not seem to like any of the things that most young people like because of this i become worried that i am not doing something right and wasting my youth is there anyone here in a similar situation and if so how do you deal with it and how is it different for you
i am in my second year of college and i have not been to a single party yet
i am usually a bit anxious but i have just been having a ton of anxiety lately 6 full on panic attacks in about as many weeks triggers have included nova cane at the dentist touching someone s hand and worrying they had drugged me with a rare date rape drug that soaks through the skin tomatoes corn a frozen banana and most recently nothing like i just had or am having but am trying to keep cool about a panic attack over nothing there i was taking magnesium before bed like always i walk in the bedroom and convince myself that i feel weird and shoooommm i can feel the chemical dump from my brain i wonder if i am having blurry vision or are the lights just out then i remember that blurry vision was a symptom of the anxiety medicine i have been prescribed and am not taking too scary then i wonder if i have accidentally taken it instead of magnesium and then a second wave of anxiety chemicals hits it is been really hard to live like this i am not depressed but i am terrified of all kinds of irrational things and knowing that they are irrational does not stop it with the banana i thought of calling my boyfriend at work to ask him if that banana in the freezer was okay because i thought i might have accidently poisoned myself with a banana it sounds just as weird to me as it does to you it is really stressful not that i had wish this on anyone but if there is someone who recognizes themselves in this i had really like to talk to someone about it
fear of drugs being drugged
hey cannot believe i am posting this i know none of you are doctors but i would love any insight into what could be wrong with me i am 18 i have always been socially anxious when i was about 11 i developed a mild stutter that really affected my confidence i never stuttered at home it s always been psychological as stuttering is but at school in an attempt to hide it completely i would think of what i was going to say before i ever spoke this sort of lead to me developing a severe fear of stuttering and hence a block stutter which is not the classic stutter with repetitions it is a repressed stutter i always know when i am having difficulty with speech some days especially mornings before i have warmed up i feel like i can only say about 50 of the words i want to say i am a covert stutterer though no one hears a block or stutter because i can choose to not say difficult words it is so linked to my mood and when i am totally relaxed i notice that i can slip into fluent speech without noticing this has all lead to severe crippling anxiety surrounding social situations and speech i have developed some odd anxiety symptoms and feel like i am losing my mind in classroom type situations even though my speech can be fine and i have obv never been mute i have this huge sense of having no control over my body or what i am capable of doing and i fear that i am actually unable to speak at all what i mean is i will sit there in class frozen up and dying on the inside my thoughts are always if i have to speak right now i might be mute how do i know that i could speak rn if i had to this comes along with a lot of depersonalisation derealisation during these panic episodes i feel like i am totally out of my body my stuttered speech is totally psychological i tried mdma and was incredibly fluent as i am when i am home alone not interested in therapy i think helping my anxiety will help my speech a lot i just do not think talking to someone would help and medication worries me so i am not sure what to do and i am scared another odd thing coffee transforms my mood it gives me the will to live and almost balances me out in turn i have much lower anxiety much more incentive to meet people and much better speech i am not an adhd sufferer at all why does caffeine have a profound mental effect on me and help me thanks so much for reading to clarify my main issue is the incredibly horrible fear of being mute when the anxiety hits because i do feel mute and unable to control my speech i am aware that all this fear about speech is likely to do with internalised fear towards my small stutter i am big on trying to sort your own shit out if possible what would be the best strategy i am aware that the brain fucks up when you think about body functions too much would it be wise for me to try and forget about speech entirely during these anxiety attacks then they might lessen finally does this sound like severe anxiety panic disorder i manage to get through life but honestly i am beginning to feel like i am extremely mentally ill i mean i cannot manage a severe fear of being mute when i have never been mute in the stressful situations that trigger the anxiety what do i do i ve been prescribed beta blockers but they obv only control bodily response to fear and hence do not help this nightmare
fear of losing ability to speak regular episodes terrible

help calming down
hi i am new at this panicparty although i have been partying for some years now with some times of relief in the middle i just wanted to introduce myself because i am really glad to find another space of comprehension for this invisible suffering i have been doing therapy and phsycology trainings since some years now learning to take care of myself and to understand myself better so i can decrypt what my body is trying to tell me i am in a support group too and that has been a huge thing for me because people not understanding this is one of the biggest fountains of suffering i have with this kind of comments you should distract yourself everybody has problems you are just oversensitive you have to you bury yourself etc and consider that i have generally been with an active and autonomus attitude it is not like i have been decades in my sofa feeling bad and trying nothing which could happen as well and for me deserves help and compassion but some people just do not understand because they never experienced it or they just do not feel compassionated about this sorry today i am specially angry with that i am spanish so that is why my english may sound weird see you later
new at the party
a little history i m mid 40s male history of depression not suicidal about a year ago i had a panic attack that sent me to the hospital because i thought i was having a heart attack i had a few episodes since but have learned to address the panic as soon as it starts and that usually works typically i start to feel like i cannot breathe and then i get flush heart races and i get dizzy and nauseous it always starts with a struggle to breathe or a dizzy flush feeling this morning it started after i woke up i felt sort of claustrophobic which i have never felt before then i got dizzy in the shower the claustrophobic feeling got worse and i felt like i could not breathe then came the nausea and dizziness accompanied by panic and a sense of fear dread then while still in the shower i started wondering if this is the beginning of some type of mental illness and that is when my panic escalated and i thought i was going to pass out it seems that my anxiety starts with a physical symptom and then i freak myself out about it and make things worse i am wondering if this is common for how others feel experience anxiety or if maybe something else might be going on i have an appointment with my doctor this afternoon but thought i had see if anyone else had experience like this because my doctor has admitted to not understanding anxiety thanks
i am having anxiety attacks that start as physical symptoms is this normal
a bit of background i suffer from anxiety i just graduated from college i was hoping to go to medical school but my parents were unable to help me financially my mother has racked up 60 000 in debt and my hope that my parents could help me out with rent when my savings ran out were crushed instead of moving back home another state and starting over and dealing with my parents nasty divorce i was offered a job in my college state i chose to stay here and to move in with my so who is still job searching i start my job on monday i am staying with extended family for a few weeks until i can afford an apartment and cannot help but feel like i am imposing i have maybe 60 to get me through the next week i have never been so uncomfortable everything is new everything is up in the air and the air feels pretty thin right now does anyone have advice for how to help me cope i was on sertraline for depression anxiety but stopped about a month ago after being tired of dealing with withdrawals and feeling like my life was stable enough for me to be okay but right now i wish i had stayed on it i do not like feeling like i have to rely on prescriptions to manage my emotions
nobody tells you how terrifying it is to be an adult does anyone have advice to help me calm down for a bit
i have been suffering from anxiety for a few years now i survived through college for the most part my problem right now is that i have a girlfriend of 8 months and i cannot seem to stop constantly worrying about what she is doing we live far apart from each other because we both just graduated college and moved back home she is not much of a texter so we do not talk all day but most nights we talk on the phone i have recently discovered that facebook tells you when a person was on facebook last and a lot of times i would send her a message seeing that she was just on facebook a minute ago and i would not get a response for an hour even though during the course of that hour i see that she keeps going on facebook my mind starts to think why is she ignoring me who could she be talking to instead of me what could she be doing it would be so easy for her to cheat on me and i would never know about it and my mind goes off on this tangent like a snowball rolling downhill and it really upsets me i start to feel really down and isolate myself it kills my motivation to eat to hang with friends to do anything i normally enjoy doing i just wish i could get rid of these thoughts i know i can trust her but once these thoughts start to come i cannot seem to stop them i have talked to her about this a number of times and she is been very supportive but she does not seem to understand what i am going through because she feels sad that i do not trust her and that she is done nothing wrong for me not to trust her which she is absolutely right she thinks that our relationship is strong and it upsets her that i do not feel the same way this really frustrates me because its not because of her and she takes it personally and i wish she wouldn t i do not know how to show her that and i am afraid that if this continues she will want to leave me because i am not strong enough or good enough or she will find someone that does not have this problem and leave me for him i feel like i am being high maintenance i do not know what to do
i just want to talk to someone that understands me
first of all i apologize if this is all over the place its hard for me to think straight right now i have been feeling awful for the past few days maybe a week i do not know anymore i have these obsessive thoughts that scare me and make me upset whenever i think about my girlfriend now or if i text her i start thinking about death and about how little time it feels like there is and about the end and i fear losing her even though that is years and years in the future i start thinking that life and everything is pointless and i break down i know these thoughts are irrational and i should not have them but i cannot help it i find it almost impossible to imagine not having these thoughts anymore and hard to imagine being as happy as i was before this started i am seeing a therapist soon and i am going to see my psychiatrist about a week after that but i cannot wait for that i want to be better now i do not know how to help myself my mom says she thinks i have ocd i have been diagnosed with gad and depression in the past and my medicine venlafaxine seems to have been helping with those please help me i hate living like this every day i am more than happy to answer any questions if that would help you understand my problem further
i feel so terrible i need advice
going on two years of a generalized anxiety disorder now i have had bumps ups and downs and moments of clarity but also moments of sheer insanity or so it feels i had aparticularly bad month in april and the first half of may however about two weeks ago something clicked and my anxiety shut off it felt great work felt great i could drive to work 1hr both ways with little to no fear meetings going for walks etc was no problem fast forward to this weekend and i had a stupid intrusive thought that set me off a weird lightheaded feeling dumb i knew when i had that thought it would set me off on a spiral work was fine today until about an hour ago now i am suffering from a small medium panic attack again over nothing stupid depressive thoughts or what ifs i attribute my recent healing to listening to talk radio non stop when i am not working even when i wake up early in the morning i have continued to do this but it seems like my armor is wearing off not interested in a coping mechanism per se or even a way to disract myself more than talk radio can do i know you cannot run from this and believe me i have tried what are some positive things i can do when having an attack at work or in traffic two particularly bad places for me where there is no escape
small step forward but then two steps back
so i do not know if this is where i put in the obligatory first time poster thing or what but i have known about reddit for a while only recently started browsing it by the way i am sorry if this is the wrong subreddit to post this in maybe i should explain i know i have a panic disorder i have struggled with depression and self harming and my panic attacks generally consist of hiding in a corner shaking crying and either biting myself or scratching my arms digging my nails into my arms also i am sorry if this is written badly describing my feelings does not come easily to me but it is less difficult when it is words on a screen i can almost pretend it is a story stories help me escape from the usual thoughts of low self esteem you know the ones you re fat you are ugly you are broken anyway it first dawned on me that i had some sort of panic disorder at my first job it was a mess i will spare the details to preserve the data protection act suffice it to say when someone who has been working in her first job for 10 months fresh out of getting a level 3 diploma in childcare and has been struggling with panic attacks and this was known to the manglement by the way do not put them in charge of the baby room for a day consisting of ten infants ranging from 0 2 years some of whom had medical requirements and with only an apprentice a new employee and an utterly useless student to help breaking more than a few laws in the process i bit myself so hard in my last week there that i left bruises on my arms both of them i was hitting my head against the wall brooms scratching my arms i walked out and did not go back that same year someone i loved like a grandfather had died and i got pulled into the office a few weeks later and was told you are not as cheerful as you normally are it does not matter what is going on you leave your feelings at the door by the day manager the same day manager suggested that i seek professional help when she saw the bruises on my arms the friday i walked out and never went back it was not a great year for me i will admit it was not easy to have the courage to get help least of all because of lack of support from my mother if you might have these issues what does this mean for me not to mention the screaming about how she wanted to kill herself sometimes after i had admitted to her that i had contemplated suicide but oh well but i got cbt and it helped for a while i have a new job in a completely different field and i like it there it is a good place but i have noticed something aside from the occasional panic attacks i know about those i can deal with them but these i do not know how to describe them it is my own mind telling me this no mistake but they are like orders urges they take over my thoughts hit your head against that wall hit your head hit your head make it bleed hit your head hit your head and it is usually accompanied with this massive feeling of dread scratch your arms scratch them scratch them scratch them dig your nails in dig dig dig make them bleed make them hurt make them bleed it does not make me feel better i feel ashamed of myself i know it is not right but what do i do every time it happens i have this overwhelming feeling that something is going to go wrong that i have to do this like it is a punishment for something that really i know i have not done wrong i talk to a customer on the phone i hang up and for a while i am okay then it hits digdigscratchyourarms scratchthemscratchthem you are bad you are broken look at you you are disgusting and it will not leave me alone until i give in it was ten fifteen minutes of me sat at my desk today taptaptapping with all of the fingers on my hand while it felt like something was in my left forearm and the only way to get rid of that feeling was to dig in with my nails that the only way to get these thoughts to stop was to give in i won today i did not give in but what about next time is this just me how do i deal with this i do not want to talk to my family i once i do not know whether it was because i had had a bad day or what but i was in the kitchen doing my laundry and suddenly i knew about the knives the sharp ones the ones that could do the most damage and i was not sure i could stop myself i started screaming bloody murder making sure i would not go anywhere until someone came my older brother came to see what the fuss was about no one else moved mother probably did not know she is hearing impaired and she has been all her life so it has not exactly been plain sailing for her either but he sat with me until i started to calm down and then mother walked by and made a face at me you know the one where someone imitates a crying face at you my brother told her to go away and the day after my irate father turned up wanting to know why my brother and i had told her to f off anyway that is why i do not raise this with my family i have not told them what i am really thinking because i am sure mother would just come up with something even worse that happened to her sometimes i just want to drive off a bridge she screamed one night after the toilet blocked and my brothers and i were trying to unblock it she wanted to use the toilet and it was the only one in the house so i cannot talk to her she also insults my personal hygiene which does wonders for my self esteem mother have you eaten fish lately or has it just been that time of the month for you all right do not get upset i love you too mother dearest i think a character from a computer game who murdered all of her children is more pleasant than you aside note has anyone noticed how fondly the night mother talks about cicero how sad she seems for him my brothers i do not want to bother them and my father s only just going back to work after being off on sick for five months by sithis what a sorry mess i am tl dr i get mental orders from myself to hit my head on things or to bite scratch my arms that are nearly impossible to ignore how do other redditors cope with this please let me know if the formatting does not make sense i will do my best to amend it update i have booked an appointment at the doctor s in a few weeks time i will take an adapted version of this post with me and see how it goes update 2 went to the doctor today he is referred me to the point of access team for another course of cbt because i felt it helped me the last time i went for it and i have got some medication to see if it helps of course there ll be follow up appointments to this but i feel like it s maybe not progress exactly because i have not gone anywhere but i feel like something s being done i am doing something about this
i know what i am doing is not normal but how do i cope

do you think we should talk about our mental health earlier in life

my mom passed away at the end of january it was really complicated and surprising i was totally blindsided i took a week off and have kept it together for two months went through crazy changes at work and now it feels like it is catching up with me i have had severe panic disorder and agoraphobia for a decade or more but it was almost completely under control after two years of therapy cbt i went from a shut in to a full time people facing employee after my mom died with the expected situational depression came even worse panic every morning i wake up with it i cannot talk or move i shake i sweat profusely and the nausea is intense it is hours of this if i am lucky i can breathe my way out of it and make it into work i am not usually very lucky and have to take meds and delay going in i have tried waking up at 6am to give myself time but the panic arrives on its own timetable i guess i am really exhausted from fighting it from the insomnia and from managing attacks at work fleeing to the bathroom to breathe is really hard when you are a main point of contact for everyone i am not eating because nausea and that is not helping much either my company is growing and we are bursting at the seams while we get a new office so the crowding and extreme noise make work incredibly difficult as well because of the agoraphobia it s not gone it is never gone just muted i feel like a terrible employee and a worse human being because of having to rely on my team so much constant guilt at the same time i feel really upset that i cannot mourn my mom the way i need to does anyone have any advice on this should i bite the bullet and ask for some more time off to properly handle this am i just being lazy and silly i do not want to let down my team i really love my job and work and part of the reason i feel so bad is because i know how much my performance is suffering thanks everyone

i have just been hired as a front desk receptionist for a small spa and i am excited and optimistic for the opportunity but i am also very prone to panic attacks which has made it difficult for me to continue school and live in a big city i am worried that my panic could cost me my new job if i am not super careful or that it will cause me a lot of pains i regularly get on the verge of a large attack but only once and a while do i actually boil over and enter a full blown panic episode i do not have any constant triggers it is more like on my bad days everything becomes a potential catalyst for an attack sometimes i cannot even smell coffee without my heart rate going crazy and getting lightheaded i have been able to hold down a solid 15 credits of school since september and along the way i discovered more about my panic and how to work around it some mornings i will wake up and know that i am going to have an attack later in the day so i will not travel the 45 minutes of public transportation to sit in a crowded classroom does anyone have any advice for upholding a job while prone to panic attacks should i inform my boss what about any future bad days i might have and how to call in an absence in that case
any advice for a newly hired customer service employee who is prone to panic attacks

i am in school right now and i am never able to stop freaking out i am constantly shakey and have really shallow breathing help
how can you get over anxiety during school
i have been suffering from anxiety issues for the past 8 years and it does not seem to be getting better little things worry me to the point that i feel like i cannot function and just want to be alone until i calm down i feel like the anxiety causes me to be easily agitated and depressed most of the time many of my friends ask why i am not being myself but just do not seem to understand when i try to explain so i keep everything to myself now i am single and that stresses me constantly many times i have thought it would help tremendously to have someone i can trust and talk with to help me deal with issues i have tried several medicines that do not work but succeed in making me fee like crap people who have never experienced it just do not understand what it is like to have anxiety when i do try to talk about my issues i get the feeling people think i am whining i guess they do not really know what to say so their response is generic i e oh or ok hopefully i have found a place where i can say how i am feeling and have others understand thanks for listening
understanding what it is like to live with anxiety
so my mom recently found out that she has a benign tumor which really freaked her out and this anxiety escalated possibly partly due to the stress she has been under for the past few years with my father recovering from a life threatening disease it is gotten to the point where her doctor prescribed antidepressants to stop her crippling panic attacks and she is easily triggered by medical imagery talk of surgery tumors etc i live abroad so i cannot be there for her except when i am home on breaks like past christmas but we keep in touch a lot luck would have it that now my boyfriend also has a tumor except a malignant and possibly life threatening one which obviously is a lot for me to take normally i would immediately share this with my mom and she would shower me with love and support but i just do not know if she would be able to take it in her present state she is never met my boyfriend we ve only been dating for a few months but it still might hit a bit too close to home and i do not want to make her situation worse on the other hand it might also turn her away from her own concerns or put them in perspective but i feel like that is quite a big risk to take i would really appreciate some advice on what to do especially since i have never experienced anxiety like my mom s though i am now starting to get a taste so i find it hard to predict what this will do to her thanks in advance
should i tell my mother suffering from severe anxiety about the stuff that is going on in my life bf has cancer
hi so pretty new here but it is really nice to know there is a subreddit for nearly everything including anxiety so uh i recently developed major flight anxiety while flying to see my s o who is half a world away i m in se asia he is in north europe and it has made all our current plans for the near future extremely difficult for one i was due to fly home a few days ago but i missed the flight because i had my first major panic attack at the thought of flying terrorism plane crashing you name it i was just so scared of the flight then there was the fear of basically everything horrible happening afterwards even if i did make it home safely i have been meditating and praying but that only goes so far and any small trigger like people screaming in a video or my dad linking me to news of the jakarta attack today just brings all my anxiety to the forefront all over again and i do not know how to cope at all having cancelled and rebooked once i had rather not cancel my upcoming flight again especially since my tourist visa will expire fairly soon after then and i had like to get back for chinese new year too i cannot see a therapist or psychiatrist until i fly back though so any help in calming down and getting myself on the plane without too much fuss would be super appreciated
scared about flying home

this website called 7 cups of tea helped pull me off the brink i hope it will help you

i like this article s suggestion on how to improve our mental health through improving our thinking and feeling patterns
so long story short weed has reached a point for me considering a few things such as my tolerance pattern of use and predisposition for anxiety where everytime i smoke what i thought was up to a certain level if you will i get anxious rapid pulse sweats sometimes a need to be stagnant and comfortable in my car room some of you may know all too well for those of you that don t it can be scary only once or twice did it ever feel so severe that it reached beyond my logical brain to freak me out but generally speaking i know what i am dealing with here that being said i reached such a point a year and a half to two years ago now and it was stressful then i quit for what was at most a week and resumed use feeling better over the period between then and now i eventually began using on that level again fast forward to a month ago at this point i started to have a few days in particular that really freaked me out one day after i renounced weed for the foreseeable upcoming month i had a fake out heart attack which luckily my family was present for and did not effect me beyond some pretttty bad panic now it is been over three weeks and on halloween in addition to a few beers i had tried smoking again it was not much the half ashy remnants of a stranger s plastic sherlock pipe at a party for 2 still i felt fine i should stress that i did not try too much here anyway however the next day i decided to try just a bowl of one of my smaller bongs test things out well though it was not as bad as the other day i had described it pretty much skyrocketed to some pretty intense pulse action and lightheadedness since yesterday i have been pretty good especially knowing now for certain weed is the triggering cause so now i have a few questions to pose to you the lovely stoners of reddit the first question s are those in the title what should i do in general and what are some of your experiences with this kind of situation moving on though i have a few other smaller questions perhaps it is just the bag i have had which has been the same stuff for a while which was not hitting me like that when i had first gotten it so perhaps i need to give things more time all questions towards alleviating this issue then of course and lastly there is the issue of what this means for me for my use habit if it is necessary to discontinue i value my young college brain and future more than this weed lifestyle i have had the last 4 odd years but there are challenges that come with such a sudden potential halt in my weed smoking first of all many of the few friends i have left in this particularly puzzling time of my life are stoners and my personality itself along with a lot of my thinking patterns are kind of absorbed remnants of the general effects pot s had on me as a person so for me to forsake smoking is fine but it also means i am removing a sort of piece of my mentality to a degree furthermore i had love to date the kind of chick who smokes i cannot see myself really going for a chick who does not or at least has never i do not want my peers and such potential future partners to judge me this is all very confusing as you can imagine and this seems like a community i can reach out to thanks for reading if you took time out of your day to read all the way down here
posted this in r trees guess it was too serious for them could use some advice
hey all i mentioned a few weeks ago i thought i had sleepwalked and now the anxiety has come back curse you anxiety disorder i have an app called hot or not which i noticed has quite alot of data used during the night i thought i have sleepwalked i am nervous i might have sent something horrible or something on it and i am gonna get in trouble my computer wizz brother assures me that even though its foreground data it was probably an update i cant find any weird messages sent but what if that person blocked me or something and thats the reason i cant see it i know its probably really stupid but its keeping me up at night and i just cant function properly apparently it requires a reply from that person to send an image i dont know but its upsetting me thoughts

hey all i am posting for my boyfriend who recently started having severe panic attacks he has never been diagnosed with a mental health disorder and this seemingly started out of nowhere for him he had one about 3 months ago it was tough but eventually he calmed down and forgot about it however he had one last night that was so bad he almost went to the emergency room out of fear he was having a heart attack his symptoms include tingling numbness in his hands arms feelings of fullness in his body shortness of breath sweating chest pain etc his mother is a nurse and diagnosed him with panic attacks here s the problem he cannot get in to see a psychiatrist for another 4 weeks minimum i have called tons of offices around here and they do not accept new patients for quite some time my boyfriend is about to start a new job where he will be travelling for 3 weeks so he is nervous about having another attack while travelling for work as someone who has some knowledge of mental health disorders i know he needs some sort of xanax like medicine to take only when he feels these attacks coming on i also know that a lot of doctors especially at hospitals urgent care centers who would be able to see him right away are wary to prescribe that kind of stuff in the usa because of widespread drug abuse should he even bother to go to the walk in clinic or will it be a waste of time what kind of facility can he go to within the next 4 days that can prescribe him what he needs has anyone dealt with anything like this before i want to help him but i am at a loss tl dr my boyfriend needs to get medicine for his panic attacks right away but cannot get in to see a psychiatrist for another month what should he do
help my boyfriend has debilitating panic attacks cannot see a psychiatrist for over 4 weeks what kind of doctor should he see

i was reading a post about how the person thought her anxiety was going to be a seizure and i noticed how she had constant peeing as a symptom and that is how i am getting i cannot drink or eat anything without having to pee right after i pee probably twice an hour and if not i am in pain it is way too much for what i am eating and drinking does anyone else have this problem and know it is from anxiety what do you do about it and another question have you had issues with sexual abuse
i have extremely bad anxiety and i have to pee all the time is anyone else going through this

do you know that most conversations about mental health help break the stigma

did you know not having close friends and cliques during adolescence may be detrimental for future health
i am currently switching meds and have been on the new one vortioxetine for a month or so not sure if that could be influencing what is happening or not in the past year or so i went to a restaurant with my friend and had a panic attack there since then i have been very anxious to go to any restaurant and struggle when i end up at one my anxiety triggers what i believe to be ibs abd i end up getting bad abdominal cramps which just make me even more anxious i have always gotten anxious when i get stomach aches and such and can be considered emetophobic as well as of current i seem to have developed an anxious reaction after eating even in my own house especially to cold drinks and icecream etc i am sure there is a word or phobia to describe what i am experiencing whenever i have heightened periods of anxiety i end up eating less having no appetite which even causes weight loss i had a similar situation almost exactly a year ago i am on the waitlist to go back to my therapist but i was told it could take 8 10 weeks and school starts in 1 week does anyone have similar experiences or ideas for coping with these phobias ibs etc
anxiety phobia help
i am 19 f and i have had epilepsy for 6 years and have generalized seizures i take keppra for that so when i started having what i now understand to be panic attacks i initially thought i was in an aura and about to have a seizure they felt like this and progressed 1 warmth over heated light headed fatigued spacey immediately recognizable 2 nasusea extreme panic fear and anxiety repeated bathroom use for stomach but only to urinate 3 tremors start mild in hands then it feels like it starts in my chest and ripples across whole body like shivering almost crippling fear anxiety induced hysteria paired with crying 4 insomnia it is caused me to have to go home from several locations and even made me miss school because in my head i was about to seize i only learned yesterday from my nuerologist that this was not seizure activity my brain is unable to separate an attack from an aura due to stress being a trigger for a seizure i wonder if anyone can identify did you start a small medication how does it affect your day to day
diagnosed with panic attacks but there is more
i have never been to a mental health professional and cannot see one now due to lack of health insurance us citizen about a month ago or so i had a panic attack while under the influence and it damaged me very badly during my attack i felt like i was insane and or mentally retarded it was one of the scariest moments in my entire life ever since then any panic attack i have i get the same fear it is an overwhelming fear and seriously makes me question my sanity now it affects my work as an artist crippling my ability to complete projects because of this fear that i am actually terrible at what i do and everyone is either laughing at me behind my back or patronizing me somehow by wanting to work with me or complimenting my work it does not help the fact that i am already a perfectionist with very low self esteem i do not know what to do i want to seek help but i lack the funds i guess i just needed a place to vent as i do not like talking to my friends or family about this stuff
i have been having bad attacks and fear it is just going to get worse

this article made me realized how detrimental stigma against ourselves can be and inspired me to be more self confident
i cannot deal with rejection

my fh suffers from anxiety that often results in panic attacks which often happen right when we are supposed to be doing something like getting on a flight i am trying my best to be supportive but i am struggling with a the disappointment of constantly missing out on plans we have made and b the financial fallout i know he feels bad when i am disappointed and when we have spent x that are non refundable or used vacation days we cannot get back so i do not want to bring it up and make it worse but at the same time we are not made of money and blowing hundreds of dollars is a bit stressful any suggestions on how to deal with this do any of you have things that help you ride out panic attacks to at least attend but ideally be able to actually enjoy important events i am especially concerned about this as we plan for our wedding for obvious reasons

it is a little expensive about 4400 jpy but i am not exactly sure what it is but i am desperate and do not want to beg a doctor for meds here are some pics of it
i am having really bad anxiety since i drank again last weekend i found this otc natural medicine in japan and think it might be for anxiety or to go to sleep
so i just got home from a session of pathfinder and as soon as i walked through the door my hands begin shaking they are still somewhat shaky but i can still kind of type then my brain randomly decides to think about the worst possible scenarios it can think of and it freaks me the f out so my imagination is not mine anymore at the moment and it is venturing to unknown places even imagining myself killing random people it keeps popping up and each death is specific for each person for example there s a lot but i am too lazy to list all scenarios nor do i want to freak myself out even more by writing in detail i imagine this girl i am interested in killing herself then my dad getting in a car accident my mom does not seem to have died yet in my imagination nor have my siblings it just seems to be people i am really affectionate for and then of course i am just thinking of going on the street and just randomly stabbing people next up i randomly picture random people i have seen on the news typically teenagers who have committed suicide just appear in my bedroom like through the reflection of my monitor i turn around of course there is nothing there i also have a weird feeling that the power is going to go out and i am going to get choked by some weird ghost type figure strangely enough it feels like i need to be on skype or calling someone to feel secure even though i am extremely introverted and stay to myself almost every single day my heart is beating normally but it does not feel that way it also feels like there is a massive elephant standing on my chest and it feels weird to breathe and also as mentioned before the shaky hands i have ocd and i think there is some minor mental illnesses on my dad s side of the family if that makes any difference i also get really jumpy so most things scare me yes i am a coward smile so i do not exactly enjoy the ghost part of things nor do i enjoy the power outage idea i have never really had this issue before so why is this happening to me now any help would be greatly appreciated p s nothing even remotely traumatic to trigger these so i typically have thoughts about people dying which i believe is ocd related but everything is brand new and extremely weird so the big anxiety thing about it only happened once if and when should i seek assistance
what exactly is this and when should i seek help

post traumatic stress disorder
in the past year i have started having mildly frequent panic attacks and very frequent anxiety usually caused by social and self esteem issues every time i have a panic attack i always repeat i m sorry i am sorry because i feel like such a burden to everyone and that i am a disruption i also feel really embarrassed and ashamed its expected that i an 18 year old guy be strong and have control over my emotions but i am very emotional some times i guess it makes sense since i am a theater kid and so i always feel weak for crying and having panic attacks around other people does anyone else experience this and if so do you have any advice
i feel guilty and weak after panic attacks any advice re post from r anxiety

i feel like mental health awareness needs to be more out in the open therapyhelped
my mental health tends to be cyclical i had say this is a throaway i am not diagnosed unfortunately basically i find myself trusting people and knowing they do but then i panic any ways and it sends me into a spiral of the past i am very affected by bullying still from my school years i worry constantly i cannot stop it there are times when my brain seems to shut off and i calm down but then i panic about anything if something likes the same thing as me i feel like they like it more than me i feel like nothing is mine i cannot enjoy reading or movies or almost anything my brain is always overturning and going like some wheel i don t i genuinely don t remember a time where i felt normal i just do not know where to go and while the internet is a distraction barely i am also lonely as fuck i know you guys are not doctors i just panic all the time i am suspicious but always fucking always trusting of people why the fuck do i do this god i am a fucking idiot i just wish my brain would stop i go from feeling intensely anxious to feeling sometimes numb and actually happy when this happens and then it fades and i feel depressed i am not sure why i am typing this i have vented before on reddit and it is no one s fault but i have just never felt better afterwards i realize you are not medical professionals i just do not know where to go and i am too afraid to talk to anyone i know nobody understands me i feel like nobody cares i am always here for people this is sounding like me me me me me but i find nobody wants anything to do with me nobody wants to talk to me i am afraid to share my opinions with people or anything i feel like nobody cares as much as i do i feel things intensely i can never capitalized on that happy numb state i feel it always ends up going away
i am not sure where to go throw away

experiencing panic attacks and suggestions on how to cope

comparing ocd with ocdp and bringing awareness about medical therapy
i will try to keep this brief i am about 2 years out of mormonism i have been married for over 10 years and everything has been great for a long time my wife and are deeply in love and feel very strong in our relationship even now that religion is no longer a part of it i started to notice when we were finding new friends and associating with them that i was becoming increasingly uncomfortable with the idea that she could find attraction towards another man and even want to act on that attraction sure enough she experienced some feelings for a friend of ours nothing actually happened but after i confronted her about her feelings i m pretty observant we had an amazing moment of connection where we were able to acknowledge that feelings are ok and it happens to normal human beings soon after this however i noticed that i was having uncontrollable fears about her wanting to be close to him i would imagine 20 different scenarios all of them negative they would take control of me and i would just spiral out of control i told my wife what i was feeling and we decided i must be experiencing some form of anxiety and i decided the best way to handle it was to talk openly about it with her she is my best friend and we have gotten much closer because of it the problem is it is not going away i find that the idea of her going out with friends me staying home causes me to freak out because she might flirt or be attracted to someone else i find that i get easily agitated and i am more sensitive to completely banal things and have to kind of talk myself down to try to be normal again this typically happens about once per week sometimes less though what stinks is that i am about 6 months into this and tonight my wife was going out with friends i was trying really hard to control my feelings but just before she left i reacted poorly to something she said and realized i was spinning up and soon i was crying uncontrollably trying to manage my imagination and fear of what might be i am not sure where to go next i do not want to take strong medication but i have not even started therapy or much of anything else i figured that i was going through a phase because i was leaving religion i love my wife and my family i do not want to hurt them with my anxiety and panic issues it makes my wife sad

if i need the meds i will need the quick chuckle
i have always had a really hard time describing panic attacks to other people i can explain the physical stuff like racing heartbeat and shallow breathing but it is hard to explain what is going on in my mind but today i found a way to do it a friend asked me what my panic attacks were like i told her that it is like this you know when you are in that class you hate and you feel like it is never going to end you look at the clock after 20 min and it turns out it is only been 3 minutes but you cannot leave you just have to get through it and you start thinking and joking to yourself ahhh i am going to die in this class it is taking forever this is a pretty common experience right well my panic attacks are like that but my heart starts racing and i hyperventilate and want to cry and my whole body hurts but cant stop moving so i actually think and physically feel like i might die in that class anyway that is what i told my friend and i think it helped to give a better idea of how i feel in the moment just wanted to share because i am proud i found a way to express it and thought it may help some others
describing my panic attacks to others
i am having such an issue with not having panic attacks during class i get dissociation shaky and feel like i am going to have a seizure any tips
tips for panic attacks during class
beginning about three months ago i have been experiencing a series of strange and terrifying incidents typically they will occur when i am surrounded by a large number of people the first thing i will notice is that things generally seem off for some reason background noise seems to fade away but i become acutely aware of my surroundings i experience an overwhelming sense of dread my stomach drops and i can feel my heart pounding in my chest when this happens time seems to slow down this is not like how time seems to drag when i am bored i am literally seeing everyone around me moving in slow motion their movements also seem slightly jerky almost like i am seeing things at a lower frame rate i feel like everyone else is looking at me and everything feels surreal these tend to last for maybe half an hour and gradually things return to normal sometimes i can feel one coming on and i am able to distract myself or change my environment and it goes away do these incidents sound like panic attacks i am worried that because i am literally seeing things in fucking slow motion that this could be an early sign of psychosis or something and that terrifies me
does this sound like a panic attack or some other form of mental illness

hi all my panic disorder is basically i am constantly afraid of getting a panic attack so i tend to hold back on things that i do well yesterday i went to see a concert with a friend in brooklyn because i have been pretty good the past few months i have seen some concerts and it has not been a problem we took a train 2 subways and then a lot of walking and we finally got there then the thoughts started coming what if i start to feel one where could i go what could i do i could tell it was not going away even after i took 5mg of my ativan i decided to go home i felt pretty bad because my friend wanted to stay but i just could not stay there she decided to stay at the concert no big deal i had rather be alone during these situations anyway so i got in a taxi and it just kept getting worse i was visibly shaking i needed to take another pill i think i had one right before getting off at the terminal once i got in the terminal things got back to normal and i was okay but once i got on the train it went right back to it my jaw was clenched so tight that i could barely open it i had one more 5mg of ativan once i changed at the next station i was pretty good because i was only about 15 minutes from my car the rest of the night was fine now i am at work and i have been having these feelings come at me throughout the day they are short of course but i cannot take this forever this just makes untolerable i saw my psychiatrist for the first time in while 2 weeks ago because the attacks were becoming more prevalent he just prescribed me more ativan saying there was not much you could do i guess i am going to see a psychologist because i cannot let this turn me into a recluse is there anything else i can do that you all would recommend i just feel so helpless when the feelings come i do not know how much longer i can take this
i had a bad attack last night and now i cannot shake off the feelings of more

be good to yourself
i am going to take advantage of it by talking to people i usually would not about mental illness and are great resources
october 5th 11th is mental illness awareness week x posted
i wake up everyday and almost always feel guilty for wasting it by the time i go to bed it does not matter how productive i have been that day i always feel this overwhelming guilt at some point like i could have done something better sometimes i stay up really late 4 am 5 am just to give myself an opportunity to enjoy my day so it is not a waste but it usually does not work then if i end up sleeping too late i will wake up and just feel like nothing in my day is even worth doing because i already wasted too much sleeping as a result i get about 4 hours of sleep on average for those wondering i do not just lay around my house all day i know that the things i do are something i paint do crafts talk to family get ready for school in a few weeks etc i am sorry if this is the wrong place it does cause me to have anxiety attacks so i think it fits here i was just wondering if anyone else had the same thing and if they had any help
does anyone else constantly feel guilty for wasting time
hi you have anxiety too or know someone with it i had imagine and i am really glad because not many of my friends family have any fucking idea how awful i feel most of the time and it is not their fault they would help me if they could i do not know what it is like to have arthritis or a goiter or a kidney stone and i am thankful for that really but i also do not brush those things off because i cannot see the x ray that proves they exist this rant really is not about them anyways it is about how much i hate having anxiety i m sorry i will say it right now yeah it is a pity party usually i am pretty strong and able to continue on with my day life but i just need this to go out into the electronic universe to someone anyone who gets it to anyone who understands what it feels like to be going on with your day whether your at work or out with friends or with family you have not seen in forever and you are fine you are enjoying yourself for a few until it starts it could be a strange feeling in your throat maybe you feel light headed or maybe an unusual smells makes you think you are about to have a seizure and die and then it snowballs and wherever you are whatever you are doing does not matter you are no longer present and are being robbed of who you are and your time because all you can think about is what is happening i feel so sick am i about to faint is this it and the rational part of your brain that is a little pussy piece of shit at this point says you know what this is you are fine but it does not matter you still end up in the er a few times even if you are on a date with someone you really really like or a dream job that you have finally landed it does not matter you are a slave to anxiety s your brain s fucking melt down and the explanations get harder and harder to give sorry i think you are really really awesome but we cannot go to the cinema because i might get dizzy and die the days of feeling like this turn into weeks which become months and inevitably years you go to a few doctors who run the standard tests and deem you physically fine you then try meds that may or may not work for you in my case the latter and talk to psychiatrists who are very lovely and understanding but in all honesty cannot possibly imagine what it is like to carry this shit around with you for years upon years upon years unless they too have anxiety and if so then kudos to them i do not mean to stereotype and before you know it you are online trying different methods that might help mostly because it is from someone who seemingly has made it to the other side of zero anxiety charles linden i am looking at you mate zero anxiety how much would you fucking give to never in your life have to deal with this absolute bullshit again i have thought about that a lot and i truly would give a hell of a lot in fact if the bargain was i had have to give up five years of my life so i had live to say 65 instead of 70 i had do it in a heartbeat but then i realize i have already given up 5 years of my life to it so really that number is 60 and i think about the future and that number growing even higher and the thing that kills me is i do not even have this half as bad as some of you out there i can go out though there was a time when i couldn t i can work i have wonderful family and friends and i know that is not the case for so so many and that is why it fucking kills me to bits when people say to me omg if i do not finish this assignment i will have a panic attack or oh i get anxious too everyone gets anxious i know this but it is not the same thing i do not need to tell you this it just feels relieving to say it do you remember what it feels like to not be anxious do you actually remember because it is getting harder and harder for me to to remember what it is like going to a restaurant and not wanting to leave the entire time or going out on the town and being able to just enjoy myself and that scares me beyond belief because i am only 25 and wonder if i will be able to handle the stress yet to come okay i am done and again i am sorry i know there are options like cbt and yes i am actively pursuing solutions but there are times when i am alone and i just scream and cry and scream i know that sounds melodramatic and nic cage esque but it is true and if you are screaming too even if it is silently please know at least one person is listening sigh i feel so much better
just needed a good i f ing hate anxiety rant
hopefully someone here can relate to this and i apologize ahead of time if i begin to rant but i am having a bad day and i really need to get this out i have had anxiety for over 4 years now on and off the last year it has been pretty bad some days i do not even feel like i want to get out of bed today for instance my appetite is shot my heart rate is accelerated and my mind is racing with thoughts this all stemmed from the fact that i was supposed to meet up with a client for web design today you see since i quit my job 8 months ago i have not really left my house all that much probably not a good thing but i cannot really afford that much gas well this lady who is website i was supposed to be redoing lives 30 minutes away all last night i started thinking about the time it will take to get there and i started getting those anxious feelings the tense stomach especially just utter nauseousness i just could not help but thinking what would happen if i got hit with a panic attack on the drive over or what if i got a dizzy spell even though i have not had one for 7 months or what if i got sick at her house just those thoughts and others like it kept going over and over and over on repeat in my mind i slept 8 hours last night but felt like i only got 3 i woke up in a panic and have worried ever since i could barely eat breakfast or lunch i was supposed to meet her at 3 and here it is at 3 20 i ended up calling and telling her i could not come why car trouble in all my years of dealing with this very very few times i have actually said my anxiety as an excuse for why i could not make something usually i will make up something like being sick or car trouble or family issues something that does not seem so bad something that does not seem like my fault i feel that by saying anxiety two things will happen either they will not understand the full extent of what i mean or they will blame me personally for just not sucking it up and going anyway i hate lying about these kinds of things to others my family my friends and myself but it is the only way that i do not feel fully guitly i absolutely hate disappointing people so i figure the less others know the better does anyone else feel the same way about this
i lie to others about my anxiety i cannot help it
i have horrible schoolwork anxiety especially when it comes to writing essays it has nothing to do with my abilities and everything to do with i have no idea i just know that i will put off a piece of schoolwork whatever it is reading taking notes an essay a lab what have you until the last possible second because every time i think about doing it i get anxious and of course the anxiety increases as the due date approaches mind you i am no high school kid i am thirtysomething and in my final year of undergrad if even thinking about schoolwork makes you have a meltdown how do you get it done i have tried breaking it into smaller pieces like working in 15 minute blocks but then i just blow it off thinking to myself enh i can pass up 15 minutes worth of work
schoolwork anxiety how do you deal with it
i have always found just going outside into the woods in my backyard and doing my breathing exercises works wonders when i am starting to get dizzy and or hyperventilate what are some of yours
what are some of your safe places
four days ago i had my first panic attack i was at a friend s just watching tv when i started to notice my heartbeat rising for quite a while i tried to ignore it got fidgety went to the bathroom a few times and generally made excuses to pace around nothing helped eventually i went into blind panic my breathing went crazy ideas of heart attacks span around and around in my head i could not hide it from my friends any longer i stood up and told them how i felt grabbing one of them in a hug and telling them i thought i was going to die thankfully one of my friends had been through panic attacks before she recognised the situation and talked me down although it did take at least half an hour until i accepted that maybe i was not dying and started to slightly relax i say relax but it took over 12 hours before i felt remotely normal again i saw my doctor today he listened took my blood pressure and listened to my heart and lungs and reassured me that physically i seem ok which was a huge relief however he said that i was showing some signs of depression he did not offer me any drugs to help but i have been told a cbt therapist will be getting in touch at some point to arrange a meeting my main problem is what do i do in the meantime i cannot shake the feeling that another attack could happen at anytime i feel like i am constantly monitoring my own heartbeat and have to make a conscious effort to keep it anywhere near normal i have googled a few techniques to keep it in check but that still just feels like i am arming myself for a constant battle with my own mood is this normal how do you guys cope sorry if this is an over long post and i know similar things must have been posted before but any replies would be greatly appreciated thanks also sorry about the big blocks of text i normally hate reading them myself but i literally have no idea of where to break up a description of a panic attack edit did actually break it down a bit
got my first ever panic attack a few days ago and could use support
i started taking paxil after trying like six other types of medications from prozac to wellbutrin to remeron and several more last night i began taking the full dosage my psych has been slowly increasing the dosage to minimize side effects and i realized today that i am having a great day despite the fact that the day is nothing special and that in fact all has been well for a while now in short i think i might have finally found something that works for me so those of you feeling frustrated with the process of trying to help yourself do not give up it does get better
just wanted to submit a positive post this time my anxiety is almost completely under control at this point fingers crossed
my mind is my own tool i am not at it is mercy when the terror creeps up from my stomach coursing into my limbs and chest i allow it to pass through me like water through a tube i do not resist i do not desperately seek escape or relief the only way out is through i breathe i manually pick my thoughts up from the terrifying track they are running and place them on higher safer ground i keep them there like a hand put out to steady a wobbly toddler i run words of truth and calm through my head i breathe the past does not control me what ever happened last time and the time before that was then this is now i have more knowledge and skill than the last time this happened i choose to use those abilities now i feel discomfort that is all it is discomfort not death not insanity not crushing helplessness not disaster discomfort can be survived i breathe this will pass each time i undergo and then rally from this fear i have put one more solid tight fitting stone in the wall between me and this ever happening again i chose to turn away from this i say no you will not consume me tonight i can withstand you i control you not the other way around breathe
these touchstones have helped me when it is bad what are yours
i am going to guess that no two panic attacks are exactly the same for me it starts as a feeling of worry with no physical symptoms eventually i get a tightness or an empty feeling in my chest the best way i can describe it is the feeling you get when you see a gruesome injury or hear the words we need to talk i have got some bad news this feeling grows and grows and is the dominating feeling of the panic attack it is by far the worst thing i have ever experienced i feel like my heart is going to explode or stop completely or literally turn into a black hole and suck me in other symptoms are shortness of breath heart pounding shaking nausea and an uncontrollable urge to cry mentally i feel one of two ways either that i am about to die or that the panic attack will never end and i thus want to die after the panic attack i usually feel nauseous and depressed for the rest of the day or even for a few days after does anyone else experience panic attacks similarly or have a vastly different experience i have never talked to another person who has had a panic attack about how it feels so i really do not know what is normal
what does a panic attack feel like

hi r panicparty i made a comic for you hugs
first of all i am a 23 year old female i have always been a little neurotic and paranoid most of my life but most of the time that comes off as spunky hyper ness but now that i am getting older and i have the stress of real life i have been getting panicky and always during random times most of the time it is when i have nothing to do to keep my mind off of freaking out it all started with having this completely irrational fear of either having my appendix burst or a seizure so any time i felt a tad bloated or eat something that does not agree with me i get shaky and panicky and have to calm myself down and anytime i feel the slightest headache or funny feeling in my head even if it is not physically painful i start to feel numb shaky and panicky i thought i was just a hypochondriac but after googling any symptoms of some disease i thought i had i kept coming across anxiety attack sites sometimes i am scared to even calm down and go to sleep because i keep thinking something bad is going to happen to me that i need to address right now one of my worst attacks happened while i was watching tv with my boyfriend and then all of a sudden i started feeling funny and any noise i heard felt like a sensory overload almost i felt like i was going to go crazy after a few minutes of pacing around drinking water and talking with my bf i calmed down i have never passed out or anything yet because anytime i feel a panic attack coming on i rationalize myself through it i guess i just want to make sure this is in fact an anxiety disorder not some underlying life threatening disease that i actually have that i need to fear thanks for reading
my symptoms just wondering if other people can relate as well
i think this sub is a great place for people witn panic disorders who are seeking some advice i know that i have gotten great feedback from both those with the illness and actual therapists that being said i think this sub has room to improve i have not seen the moderator post in here so i am wondering if this was created and then abandoned or if he she still is around i have some thoughts for improving this sub which mostly deal with exposure getting listed on other mental disorder subs and such but am not sure how to go about it also it would be nice to have some relevant links in the sidebar to websites with the right kind of info people suffering from panic anxiety should know so i am wondering if any like minded people could offer suggestions of how we could improve this place and make it a stronger community with better resources i do not want to sound pompous but i had be interested in becoming a mod just because i am on here almost every day but do not know who i had talk to about that i think i will pm torvaldr edit i pm ed torvaldr and am waiting for a response at the moment keep bringing the ideas edit2 i am going to wait three or so days and then submit to redditrequest in case torvaldr does not get back to me edit3 i waited for a few days and never received a message back from torvaldr therefore i have sent a request to become a moderator of this sub hopefully everything pans out soon
is anyone interested in improving this sub

i cannot believe this place exists i am so grateful i was starting to think i was the only one dealing with this nightmare
anyone have any panic attack stories they want to share my first panic attack happened at work while i was driving a car i immediately pulled over and slammed on the breaks jumped out of the vehicle and stumbled to the ground i thought i was dying i had my friend co worker who was in the passenger seat drive me to a doctor one time i was on the metro and i had a panic attack when the train was going through a long tunnel i spent five minutes felt like an hour freaking out in the car pacing up and down the aisle trying not to break down before the train got to a stop i spent about 45 minutes at a random station pacing around and convulsing before i could bring myself to get back on the train and continue going to where i needed to be i was at a busy station but i have never felt more isolated in my life edit hey everyone thanks for sharing your experiences looking at the stories redditors have shared it is clear that just because people suffer from anxiety it does not mean they are incapable of demonstrating lots of gall which in my mind is a positive trait of survival you all rock hard thanks for your inspiration
where is the worst place you have had a panic attack
i get anxiety going on long trips going to work when someone else is in the washroom basicailly everytime i am in a situation where if i needed to take a shit it wouldent be the best moment to do so anyone else dealt with this how did you work through it i am having some success with accepting the anxiety and telling myself its just my body being foolish and to trying to just live with it but if someone else has more information i would love to hear it
anxiety makes me think i am going to have to shit at inopportune times

created the blog for anxiety sufferers written by those who have it tell me what you think
i am a web developer and really wanted to start a blog about something i have seen a few blogs out there about anxiety but most deal with treatments for it not about what happens when you have it would anyone be interested in something like this
would anyone be interested in a blog from someone who suffers anxiety about different anxiety panic related topics
i have read a lot of posts from people who suffer panic attacks and describe a symptom they think might be related i endured a full 11 years of anxiety before medication resolved it and thought i would share a list of the physical symptoms anxiety used to cause the spectrum of physical issues that stress can manifest in a person is incredible and the symptoms i experienced seemed to cycle change and randomly come and go since medication the following have thankfully been resolved spots in vision like a camera flash induced after image fuzzy vision like static when looking around in dim light or at dark objects long lasting after images and trails in vision numbness and tingling in extremities coldness in extremities night sweats blotchy pattern on hands due to constricted blood vessels a sense of being off balance or about to fall feeling as if about to pass out constant pounding heartbeat followed by panic when it was not felt upon relaxing fluttering heart palpitations thump feeling in chest muscle tension all over back and neck muscle twitches muscle spasms in neck that caused dizziness faint feeling difficulty breathing feeling breathing was not taking in enough air metallic taste in mouth exploding head syndrome yep it s feeling as though death was imminent and a total loss of control i will note that none of this was predictable with me save that the feeling of nearly passing out was very frequent on long drives these symptoms and panic attacks were mostly random unexpected and came out of no where which made it all the worse good luck to anyone that is going through similar work with your doctor keep close with family and friends you will find something that works for you and makes you feel normal again
a list of symptoms all the ways anxiety messed with me
i have been traveling and away from home so much that the loneliness has been soul crushing and once my thought process turns on me like that i start to obsess and over analyze everything i have convinced myself that i have copd or emphysema because of a cough i have had i have called off work because i was too tired and too frazzled to think about working i spent the entire shaking and hyperventilating and crying i keep wanting to go to the doctor but i know they are gonna scoff and tell me i am fine i feel trapped i cannot shake the feeling that i am terminally ill even though i know it is in my head it is just really difficult to shake once anxiety starts to manifest itself physically i need a way to calm myself down does anyone have any good tips
it is been a terrible week for anxiety for me does anyone have any good tips for calming themselves down
a little back story anxiety and depression run in my family but i never thought i had cause to worry about it because i lived 26 years without ever experiencing true anxiety or at least chronic anxiety i have had spells of depression but who hasn t nothing major but i will say the depression has kicked in a little more lately as i have been experiencing both depression and anxiety for the past 7ish months dna aside i feel my anxiety was brought on by a massively bad shroom trip that ended with me in the er ashamed and embarrassed i thought i was dying called an ambulance since that frightful day i have not smoked weed or eaten shrooms and i do not plan to ever again drugs are behind me forever even if i do somehow find a sure fire cure for this i do not even know why i made this post it just has a tendency to break you down and make you desperate for anything you know recently i moved back in with my family to save up for an engagement ring shortly after i got laid off from work so i have had ample time to sit around the house and think as most of you probably know all too well thinking can be torturous i wish i could just chill out ignore the churning stomach and continue my day calm and clear but i cannot i lost my medical insurance but recently applied for another plan if i get approved i am seeing a therapist asap what is ridiculous is my fear seemingly stems from nothing most of the time i just get scared of being scared and when i am not scared i get scared of the possibility of being scared it is a vicious cycle in which the fear fuels itself so i have been looking into meditation and soon to be dieting exercising also looking for a new job and looking to start college just trying to insert a lot of positivity into my life what have you guys found that helps
so i have joined the wonderful world of anxiety
i am so overwhelmed right now i am a 21 yr old female full time student and work as well i have been missing school and work because of this almost two weeks ago on friday night when trying to go to bed i had a panic attack i am not sure what triggered it but it freaked me out since then i have not been able to sleep for days or eat i will have random panic attacks triggered by monitoring myself i am full of anxiety pains and now this is leading to depression for fear that i will never get out of this now my obsession is on my breathing it was first only when i went to bed to try and sleep i would monitor my breathing to the point i got so anxious i could not sleep to the past few days i have been constantly monitoring my breathing all day long with a fear that if i stop controlling my breathing that it will stop all together i am desperate to get this out of my mind and i want to go back to living normally when i did not even notice my breathing i really would like to sleep and function normally again any advice
help panic attack has completely taken over my life
latest one for me just happened a while ago while i was driving before i had left my apartment i had taken an ibuprofen my head felt funny idk how to describe it each time i freak out my head does not hurt it just feels slightly funny or maybe i just think and focus too much on it anyways i started driving with the windows down and tried to convince myself to stop being crazy and that i was okay but then my heart beat got faster and then i convinced myself i was about to have a sensory overload seizure or black out at any moment so i took the nearest exit i always take out my phone in case i have to call someone or 911 or something ridiculous i calmed myself down enough to drive back home when i got here i felt a little drowsy and started semi freaking out again because i did not know why i felt tired and convinced myself i was going to black out again or something but i am now calm i hate this i feel like my brain is separate from me and just freaks out when it wants to every time i have to rationalize with myself that i am just crazy but okay how do ya lls start out is it always random and crazy like mine edit i have since been to my local towns clinic told the doctor about my anxiety and they prescribed me anti anxiety medicine i forget what it is called but it is wonderful it helps send serotonin to my brain no more panic attacks
how do your panic attacks usually start

was not sure where to put this but this seems like the best place anxiety rage true story
so i am surfing reddit trying to distract myself from my anxiety while the 2 xanax i just popped kick in and i find this place throwaway account but i thought i had just put this out there in case anyone is listening and just as an excercise in catharsis i have had anxiety panic problems for about 3 years regarding my health mainly regarding my heart lungs and chest oddly specific right my issues stem from a surgery i had when i was 19 to repair pectus which was ironically voluntary i had it done because of self image issues that i have now grown out of anyway i was laid up in the hospital for 2 weeks recovering during which my right lung collapsed if you have never had the pleasure of experiencing a pneumothorax its akin to slowly becoming unable to breath while each breath feels like someone is stabbing you with a pincer down from your shoulder into your lung by the time the dr s got in their to fix the problem i could barely breath 6 months of recouperation taking it easy out of the hospital and another 6 months of normal living occurred before i first started having symptoms of anxiety panic attacks at the time i was a heavy marijuana user and the attacks would only occur when i got high so i quit smoking cold turkey nearly immediately but a few months later they started to happen when i was sober for me my anxiety mostly manifests itself with thoughts that something is wrong with the area affected by the surgery i will be sure that my lung is collapsing again or that my chest wall sternum is collapsing back into me or that i am having a heart attack i started having these more frequently and it was debilitating almost once a night add to the fact that they usually occured at night and i was getting almost 0 sleep i eventually found a psychologist and he walked me through some excercises gave me a mild xanax perscription for emergencies and basically just let me talk it out with him this helped and after a while they started to go away its been nearly 2 years since i have had them with any sort of frequency but i just got hit with a real bad one tonight after having a few mild attacks earlier in the week its probably the stress of finals coming up but i am out of my mind worrying that i am going to go back to the way it was before i have moved across the country since i had them last and do not have a psychologist i can talk it out with over here anyways sorry for the rant i really just needed to vent
i thought my anxiety was gone but tonight it came back w a vengeance
is anyone else triggered by school and all that surrounds it it seems that anything having to do with school triggers at least mild anxiety in me at times it is gone to the point of absolute debilitating fear of anything school related a little background i am in my early 20s and trying to receive my bachelor s in communications i am good at what i do in terms of speaking writing and networking it comes naturally to me and always has however i have not had your typical college experience a few things both personal and out of my control have happened since i graduated high school back in 2004 causing me to sometimes delay working towards my bachelor s i enrolled at a private university immediately after high school but the cost ultimately drove me to transfer to a state college closer to home so i could commute after that problems at home both economic and otherwise caused me to work full time withdraw from semesters and take a semester off here and there once everything seemed to be going more smoothly i re enrolled and then had to move to another state in the middle of another semester causing me to delay this process even more however i always maintained the will to finish school and everywhere i moved i enrolled in school so as not to fall behind however now i am in the process of applying for colleges once again to complete my bachelor s most people i talk to sort of commend me for not giving up while the others i can sense are quite judgmental of my situation and do not understand what i have been through and how badly i am trying to overcome it i know that people go back to school every day even at 30 or 40 years old and i am nowhere near either but because it has taken me so long and there have been so many setbacks i am absolutely riddled with fear that something is going to happen to delay the process even more i know that this is irrational negative thinking that will get me nowhere but because of my history it seems only the natural pattern i also understand that my negative feelings toward the situation are only prolonging my fear and adding to my stress causing me to sometimes physically give up and panic uncontrollably there have been times that i have woken up early driven all the way to school prepared parked and have become so overcome with anxiety that i actually could not even get out of the car i have never told anyone this because i feel it is hard for people to understand but that is what i mean by debilitating it is the feeling of overwhelming stress and anxiety to the point where my body just does not move i cannot open the car door or leave i just sit there until the feeling passes sometimes i had walk in very late after sitting in the parking lot for so long or just drive away is it because school has become such a negative symbol in my life that i am actually sub conciously afraid of it if so how do i overcome this has this happened to anyone else it is so hard to understand because it is not laziness or lack of will it is bizarre to me and although it does not happen often when it does i become so angry with myself further propelling the anxiety cycle and for the record i used to be a straight a student and have an absolute love for school up until things started going awry in my family life and school became a source of anxiety it is almost like if i cannot do it perfectly i cannot do it at all if anyone has any input or tips on how to control this fear anxiety and panic please let me know tl dr school causes debilitating fear and panic sometimes help
iae triggered into panic because of school
i do not suffer from panic attacks but i do have bouts of elevated anxiety i am going through one right now and that fucking movie has left me with this overwhelming sense of dread i threw up this morning and i think it was partially a result of that anyone care to share similar stories
i watched eraserhead this weekend big mistake now my anxiety is through the roof what are some dumb things you have done to accidentally set yourself off
i suffer from periods of cyclical panic attacks where i basically am at 97 anxiety panic for hours or days at a time it is hard to sleep eat anything i am in one of these periods right now and it is perhaps the worst i have ever experienced in my 10 years of suffering with this i am on day six and the last five days have been pure hell the reason for this post is i am getting a bunch of weird symptoms that i do not usually have and they are just not only are they extremely distressing but it is freaking me out that i am dying or something and dismissing it as a panic attack i mean i know that is not the case i ve seen my doctors but i cannot stop worrying about it so in the name of making me feel less alone more normal has anyone ever experienced any of these symptoms during panic attacks or periods of really bad anxiety chills and a low grade fever only a degree or two high i am sure this is not a normal fever because taking anti pyretics asprin tylenol have done nothing for it and it only started with the onset of the cyclical attacks but it is making me feel horrible like i have the worst flu in the world i am hot then freezing then hot again my doctor said it was a stress fever but dsjk really severe body aches like i have been in a bar fight intermittent numbness of the face and arms to the point where i can bite pinch my skin hard and feel nothing really bad acid reflux and occasional barfing of bile stomach acid i also keep getting really hungry but after the first bite of food i feel like puking if anyone could offer some empathy or advice or anything that might help i would be eternally grateful 3333
having cyclical panic attacks does anyone else get chills and other weird symptoms x post from r anxiety
okay so for the last few years i have noticed something first of all my panic attacks really come randomly i usually do not get them that often maybe once every other month a big one will happen they usually leave me pretty much doing nothing the rest of the day with an on edge feeling nothing really triggers them other than the fact that they usually occur on days where i had bad or little sleep the night before and i wake up just feeling off however one symptom i have noticed is before i get a panic attack my legs specifically my calves feel shaky or weak it slowly gets a little and little more worse over the span of about 15 minutes then boom panic attack my heart and thoughts race for anywhere from a few to 10 or 15 minutes then i just feel physically exhausted and my legs and fingers shake for about 30 min to an hour after i hope this is anxiety does anyone else experience something similar i will be seeing a therapist starting the beginning of next month and i will tell them about this
anyone else have shaky legs before getting a panic attack
well kind of i have had panic attacks over medical stuff and sometimes over going crazy and for awhile they were a near daily affair before getting on an antidepressant now a lot of my anxiety was about suicide i felt hopeless and all but more than anything i was worried that i would one day kill myself it was hard telling the difference but i think it is more true that i was worried about killing myself more than i was actually suicidal i am also anxious that i will be depressed for a long time hearing about david foster wallace brings my day down i have not read his work but the idea of someone killing themselves once they are old and mature and not in any extenuating circumstance gets to me because i am worried that i will not ever be over this the panic attacks over this anxiety start with a thought and it snowballs the other panic attacks end after an hour or so but i will be literally writhing with anxiety for hours and can never really sleep well i just want to know if i am the only one
anxious about anxiety
on tuesday i had a panic attack it was a big one with ambulance and screaming i m dying it was also only the second big one i had first one happened 1 5 years ago on my birthday because i got really drunk and then smoked some ridiculously strong weed this time i did not drink did not smoke trees stopped after the first panic attack or anything else i was sick and was taking tamiflu and codeine cough syrup as prescribed it started with me getting mildly light headed and feeling suspicious as if something is about to go wrong i went to the kitchen to my wife and had few glasses of water and said that i was not feeling good at that point i was already freaking out and thinking that something terribly wrong is happening my fingers started getting numb and tingly which made me freak out even more so i ran into my son s room and fell on the floor thinking that i am dying my wife ran up to me and asked if i was ok i told her that i was not and that she should make a call the language i used by that point i was completely overtaken by sheer terror i was kneeling on the floor in my bathrobe rapidly breathing my hands going almost completely numb my wife opened the window so i crawled up to it and started taking deep breathes and desperately trying to collect my thoughts somewhere on the back of my mind there was a voice of reason telling me to look back at my first panic attack and realize that i was just having another one but the terror was too strong i thought about how much i loved my son and how it would be real shitty to die and leave my wife as a single pregnant mother each one of those thoughts only multiplied already unmanageable fear of death finally the ambulance came at that point i decided to try to get up and see if i can dance the attack off i walked into the ambulance shaking and dizzy but after getting all of the basic test done and relaxing a bit i refused further treatment and went home it is been 48 hours since it i went to work today and just got back home i am feeling emotionally drained and ashamed of putting my family through the stress and not recognizing what now seem like obvious signs of a panic attack i want to hide away from everyone i want to get together with someone i really trust drink a bottle of whiskey and talk my ass off about what happened to me at the same time i could not force myself to admit to a work buddy of mine that i need someone to talk to and hoped for him to figure it out on his own not really sure where i am going with this anymore but thank you for reading
had my second full scale panic attack on tuesday
i am haunted by the horrible fear of dying all the time i suffer from anxiety obviously and have had three major panic attacks in the last month three years ago i started having these thoughts what if something happens to me what if that strange thing i felt in my arm is a heart attack what if what if what if in the last three years i have had very good days and i do not think much of it but because of stress my anxiety levels reached the sky and i started having panic attacks again ever since the first panic attack about a month ago the fear came back and now i cannot get it out of my head i am wondering if i am crazy or if i am the only person that fears death all the time and relates everything to that fear i am even starting to think bullshit like what if i get all these fears because something is actually going to happen i am tired of always being perceptive about what goes on in my body i am waiting for every kind of sensation or little pain and immediately think it is something serious i am sick of it all so i decided to let it all out on this lovely subreddit and begin a new phase fearless i have to understand that it is all in my head and it cannot get out of it i am perfectly safe has any of you ever felt that kind of fear i apologise if my voc and grammar are not very good
constant fear of dying that ends today
hey panicparty today i woke up feeling like shit i was not having a stroke or on the verge of having a heart attack nor did my chest hurt i felt like i was burning up but that is because it was a warm day and the heater did not really need to be on i had a massive hangover and it was the first day of feeling like shit for the longest time where i was not concerned it is the first day of 2011 and i feel optimistic about things still gonna try and not drink and i want to run a lot more in the coming year still freak out about the little aches and pains but things are a lot better from where i stood 6 months ago 2010 was a year of panic attacks and anxiety but i think 2011 will make all of that a memory thanks for being my webmd and helping me get over my ills i feel like the only thing that could cause a panic attack now would be losing this subreddit
i was not dying today

scientists pinpoint source of anxiety in brain scan study for the first time new more effective treatments could be around the corner
so i spent the weekend with my mom camping in the woods that was an awesome time and no stress whatsoever other than the usual mother daughter clashing which i can deal with however on the way back i had a full on unbridled panic attack probably one of the worst of my life i ended up hyperventilating in the car and sobbing for hours i have a knee injury and upon getting home and realizing i could not stand being  i ran for about a mile that was pleasant i am still a bit twitchy and avoiding reflective surfaces like the plague my reflection usually sends me into a panic conniption fit just looking for some fellow panickers to send me long distance e hugs d
epic panic attack yesterday
it has not happened often and even my closest friends do not know but from my experience it probably just looks like i am a huge spaz or overly sensitive neither of which are true really i know i should not worry about this but inevitably i do so are you worried about it how do you deal with it has anyone had experience with it what do you say to your loved ones
iae ever worried ashamed of what people think if they know or have seen you in the midst of a panic attack
curious as to what your parents are like as i am positive my family influence has a huge impact on my anxiety issues i am an only child and my parents are very loving and very overprotective my dad is high strung yet pretty worry free my mom is the most anxious person i have ever met and it took me like 19 years to realize that she is sensitive depressed and extremely critical but at the same time she is also incredibly caring loving and smart i love my parents and even truly like them as people but they are also a huge source of anxiety for me mostly because i constantly feel guilty for not being exactly how they want me to be they have very specific expectations for almost everything you can think of from ways to put away the laundry to how i should behave in my career i have struggled to live my life for me not for them but i am still very far away from forgiving myself for it what about you are your parents worriers or do you worry about them often do they factor into your anxiety at all
what are your parents like

i wrote this a few years ago it is my guide to happiness and overcoming panic
for me its usually thinking about loneliness diseases my health or worrying about my family being okay when i cant get in touch with them what are some of yours
what are some of your triggers that will almost always start an attack for you
i am a psych major i have gad and suffer from severe panic attacks the tiniest feeling that something is off in the upper left part of my chest left arm or upper back is enough to have me curled up in a ball begging my husband to please call 911 if he is not around i will have the number dialed so all i have to do is just hit the send button last semester i had been finishing up some long term therapy for a sudden increase in panic attacks i had been doing really well and had not a full blown attack in weeks when i had been having them daily and sometimes several times in one day before the therapy anyway i have a class every morning with one of the coolest teachers i have ever had he has gad and suffers from panic attacks as well well the last week of school during lecture he is discussing a past panic attack of his he always thinks he is having a heart attack he gets the chest pain and everything in this situation he began to have an attack right as he walked in from work he had been stressed all day so he expected it he did some breathing exercises and was determined to get through it he then stepped into the shower and realized that his pain was not going away like a normal panic attack his mind was thinking heart attack and he was thinking to himself that he knew better and he was going to get through this and not fool himself he gets out of the shower gets dressed and his daughter comes in and sees him in a cold sweat clutching his chest she called 911 it turned out that he was really having a heart attack that time because of this he says he will always think he is having a heart attack which makes it likelier that he will because it gets him so worked up and that just creates a vicious cycle everyone in my class thought his story was hilarious i was absolutely mortified and had to leave the room as the thought of this happening to me brought on a panic attack i always think my panic attacks are heart attacks to this day it is hard to shake that how am i ever supposed to know whether or not to get emergency medical help

reddit i suffer from agoraphobia please help
so today i woke up this morning and i have been anxious ever since my heart rate is elevated my hands are clammy and i am just generally nervous every second i had a massive panic attack yesterday and i want to know if anyone else experiences this i have had days like this about 8 or 9 times since my anxiety started about 2 years ago does anyone else experience something like this i am very afraid that it is more than just anxiety i will be calm for maybe a few minutes but it will spring up again all throughout the day any help
day of constant anxiety
i am constantly worried about it it heightens whenever i read a story about someone my age having a brain tumor or some terminal or weird disease or cancer does anyone else think this i get my panic attacks most of the time at random and i am always worried there is something wrong with me
anyone else afraid they have cancer or some disease
realizing all of this has been a crazy journey after my son was born i began really losing it worrying constantly about almost nothing at all and most especially things completely out of my control i went to see someone and after only two therapy sessions my eyes were opened to having dealt with generalized anxiety disorder my whole life i just learned to cope and deal with it really well so well in fact my mom never knew my wife of six years never knew and i never realized it was as bad as it was i thought everyone else lived the same way and therefore never thought this may be something i should not have to deal with i now have an appointment with the psychiatrist next week and am really nervous about taking medication my therapist says that after living my life this way for so long finding the right medication for me could make me feel better and more at ease than i ever have this honestly scares me i feel i always need control over myself and situations that could arise to harm me or my family i guess my biggest fear is that i will lose that control i am sorry for the long post i am just a little scared and this changes everything for me while explaining so much i am hoping there may be some words of wisdom from someone who has been there before
i was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder yesterday
after almost 4 years panic free with manageable anxiety last night i had an anxiety attack i woke up from a bad nightmare and trying to get back to sleep did not work the fear and dread lingered i awakened my partner and he tried to soothe me suddenly i found myself pacing around the living room hyperventilating and trying to get a grip through wave after wave of fear the whole time some part of my mind was thinking i remember this the tight chest short breath the feeling that i will never be happy again this is a panic attack
i am back to the panic party

deal with it is not advice
that was terrifying i have had a really really bad day and a generally crappy year lots of different stuff going on that has been causing me quite some stress i do have problems dealing with anxiety as i tend to bottle everything up and ignore my feelings i have never had a panic attack before now though it is nearly 3am as i am writing this an hour ago i was lying in bed with my so sleeping next to me my body was incredibly tense and i was attempting to deliberately loosen and relax my muscles to little avail my legs begin to twitch and then i started to have little periodic convulsions which is fairly normal for me it s a kind of way to release tension through a sudden sharp movement but these were entirely out of my control i then noticed i could distinctly hear my heart thud thud thuding in my ears and could feel the blood vessels in my neck throb to each beat i am a pretty analytical person so my first though was is this a panic attack what could be causing it i tried to slow down my heart and relax my body but it just made everything worse and my heart to pound harder then i suddenly noticed i could not breathe anymore i was gasping for breath unable to get enough oxygen that my lungs apparently needed i suppose it was a drowning sensation my body took over and i began to hyperventilate it was terrifying most of my logical brain knew that this was probably a panic attack and that they are fairly common and not threatening but then a small but very loud and insistent part of my brain was screaming that this was a heart attack and that i was going to die these two opposing thoughts apparently caused my body to become paralyzed i could not move or say anything but i was acutely aware that every muscle i had was tensed up and in a flight fight mode and that my lungs were telling me that i was not getting enough air and that something was seriously wrong all i could hear was the pounding in my head and it took all my willpower to keep the sane and logical part from being totally swamped by fear eventually the symptoms began to get less and over about ten minutes i began to slowly relax my heart is still beating a little above normal and every time i think back to it i quickly begin to feel closed in and a sense of dread i have never had anything approaching this before and yet i have had to deal with a lot of stress over my life i would not have thought that the events of the past week would illicit such an awful reaction now i am just scared it will happen again
i am pretty sure i just had my first panic attack
this subject has probably been brought up many times before but i would like a personal opinion i am 20 i have been suffering from panic attacks and general anxiety for all my life it is only had a negative impact for the last 4 years it used to happen only in school and then i ended up dropping out of high school my senior year because of it went back and finished with a diploma it has been getting progressively worse and two months ago i was forced to quit my part time job i have had for 3 1 2 years because i kept having panic attacks there i have been to therapy before and that helped a little i can control my anxiety attacks better i have also been on two different medications prozac and paxil and neither helped paxil made me more anxious i have panic attacks about twice a month and when they hit they are pretty bad the time in between them is spent constantly worrying about having another panic attack i am in a constant state of stress i am becoming agoraphobic and it is preventing me from hanging out with friends doing stuff i used to love taking even minute risks and having a successful relationship i have smoked pot a couple times before and it is seemed to help drastically but a couple weeks after i smoke i get a panic attack this probably seems like i am tying two separate events together and maybe am being a pit paranoid my question do you think that smoking cannabis every once in a while in moderation of course could help with my anxiety i am not looking for a long term treatment i know eventually i will grow out of it like the rest of my family who has dealt with this i just need something to help me get out there find a new job enjoy time with my friends and just enjoy life without fearing and being anxious literally every second i am awake edit i also get really bad stomach pains when i am anxious so i usually eat a couple tums every other day my appetite is not usually great either because of this
anxiety and cannabis your opinion
for me i really think i drive ok but panic or fear prevents me from driving my way to a place and use the bus instead i cannot help but feel anxious while driving in heavy trafifc or while overtaking
how do you overcome anxiety about driving
that is me right now worst thing ever i have to be up in less than 5 hours from now and i do not know what to do i have already gone a night with almost no sleep do i do it again anyone want to chat for a little bit
anyone ever have trouble sleeping from anxiety caused by not sleeping
anyone else stuck in this loop
anticipatory anxiety the fear of having a panic attack causes a panic attack
i think the title pretty much says it all i often find myself sitting up all night because i am simply too afraid to fall asleep i think my biggest fear is that i will die in my sleep i have tried everything that i can think of i cannot seem to just calm my mind i have cut out caffeine before bedtime i have tried reading to distract myself before bed but as soon as my head hits the pillow i become aware of my heart and just how fast it is beating and then i instantly go into panic mode and my thoughts are flooded with is this normal did it just skip a beat is my arm numb and i cannot calm down i will have a full scale panic attack and sleeping at that point is impossible i want to doubt that i am alone in this and ask does anyone have any advice
too afraid to sleep
i figured i could look around this subreddit page but i felt i wanted to just explain and see if anyone has specific pieces of advice two days in a row i have had anxiety attacks in the middle of school symptoms included troubled breathing strong pumping heart pounding headache and the most key sign breaking into tears these have most likely been due to mostly school related stress one occurred while doing a fast paced active assignment the other during study hall and before the next class when i was doing nothing the second one made me question exactly what might be setting it off though it seems to be general stress build up releasing any and all advice and comments would be of help since this is at the moment taking over my life
in need of some direct advice
my best friend and i both have anxiety disorders and comparing them often helps us understand each other so how would you describe your experience with your disorder or just anxiety in general i have both generalized anxiety disorder and obsessive compulsive disorder and it is an interesting mix the most prominent manifestation of my ocd is checking and re checking i can get into an almost endless cycle of checking the most mundane thing if i am not aware with gad i usually react to triggers but occasionally i will just have an overbearing sense of dread throughout the day i can often recognize when i am being severely affected by one or the other and make an attempt to adjust
what are your disorders like
just found this subreddit and wish i wouldve known this existed 4 years ago i felt obligated to talk about my experience and my way to cope with the panicparty i experience still just about every day to make a long story short i went on a binge drinking spree when i was 20 woke up smoked half a pack of cigs 2 cups of coffee 4 asprin and a bowl of weed before heading to work after about 3 hours of sleeo completely lost my mind waiting to take a delivery to a doctors office obgyn to be specific got to the office collapsed in the reception room woke up to nurses giving me water they thought i was dehydrated bp was 200 140 spent the next 2 months in my room only leaving to see doctors who thought i had diabeetus also spent that time on webmd diagnosing myself being a hypochondriac is just part of the ride with this disorder this was the worst idea ever i convinced myself i had cancer aids chrons vertigo diabetes etc do not do this finally made it to my parents house and saw my doctor diagnosed agoraphobic and having a panic disorder finally after 4 months of no answers i did not even know this existed people with depression and anxiety always seemed weak to me now i was neck deep in it and not questioning these disorders ever again i quit my job dropped out of school they let me back in lost a gf who also took me back lost 40 pounds because i refused to eat anything lest it make me feel any worse then the best thing that could happen to me did i met a guy at the same bar that started all this who suffered and he knew immediately what was wrong 4 years later i still consider myself a sufferer i have at least 1 minor attack a day usually triggered by something i would assume is like vertigo example ever sat in a car in park and seen a car reversing very slowly and it gives the illusion that youre going forward those sorts of things trigger me bad the biggest trigger is being hungover which is not suprising because i associate with the first big attack i had those big attacks every day for 4 months since then i havnt had ever felt the need to freak out i would just like to point out some things that really worked for me and things that didnt things that didnt work for me 1 quitting smoking cigs weed caffeine alcohol all at the same time this is a recipe for nervous system disaster if you feel like you are lifestyle is worsening your attacks ween them out 1 at a time 2 zoloft xanax was put on both never took the xanax hypochondria and the zoloft made me freak out and made it worse things that worked 1 finding natural ways to lower bp i have naturally high bp and i am positive it directly influences my attacks i did stop drinking caffeine for a long time back on it now and no probs here 2 exercise helped me get past the first few months i stopped regularly exercising since but it definately helps 3 do not change your lifestlye 180degrees in a day its stressful on your mind and body it will not help gradually move into a direction you want you life to go there is probably more but this is getting too long i can honestly say and i know a lot of people wont agree and maybe hate me for saying it that these attacks have made me a much better person i still have panic attacks but i am impressed with my own focus in curbing them its almost exhilerating i dont challenge my body but i also dont let anxiety take over you can not die from anxiety alone this can not be stressed enough talk to family likeminded people or reddit and understand that your attacks will be short if you make them so i hope this helps some people remember this is my experience and techniques at dealing with it i am not dissing drugs or anyone elses treatment options this worked for me and i am proud of myself for being able to say i am a better person because of it i have accepted this will never ever go away completely and i am ok with that i will be around for a while if anyone wants to ask any specifics or just wants to rant tl dr i have had panic attacks for 4 years i dont feel healed but i feel good about whats happening
my panic adventures hopefully someone can relate and feel even a little better
i am a 30 year old male who had my first panic attack about 3 years ago it broke me i have never been the same since i started seeing a psychiatrist immediately and was put on clonazepam i was prescribed to take 3 5mg daily i took between 2 and 3 pills a day i was still anxious all the time but never had full blown panic attacks i quickly developed a dependency to the drugs i started to ween myself off of them after about a year and felt better i was exercising and working full time without much of a problem i was still anxious most of the time today i feel better i take about a quarter of a 5mg clonazepam when i start to feel anxious and it evens me out i probably average about 1 pill monthly the problem is that i am still not right i still cannot accept that is something that i will just have to live with has anyone completely gone back to their former self i feel tremendously better than i did 3 years ago but it is still there it is still always in my mind
learning to live without panic attacks
i woke up this morning from a horrible anxiety nightmare and have been keyed up all day i did not sleep well last night and have not for the past week i recently moved to a new area and started a new job and there is been a lot of pressure for me to deliver here in a very short amount of time with not many resources available to me at the moment i have just been going a mile a minute and know i am going to hit a wall any time now my heart has been racing all day and feel like i am speed or something not that i really know anything about that but what i imagine speed to be like anyone know how i can just calm down and get back to center right now it is just been a bad week for me
really struggling today
i have agoraphobia to the point where i can barely leave the house hypochondria that is so bad i have constant panic attacks and severe dp dr i do not know how to cope i am going to therapy twice a week and it just is not helping i am so terrified of dying or getting sick it is taking over my life it is my every fucking thought i do not know how much more i can take before i lose my fucking mind i do not know what to do anymore i keep trying to convince myself i am gonna live to be old and have a happy life but i just do not see it i just know i am gonna die of some awful disease the paranoia is consuming me i just need someone to talk me through this
i cannot fucking take it
i will try to keep this short as there is so much to type about what i am going through i am a male in his late 20 s i have had an issue with vomiting since i was 10 years old i remember feeling ill one day during class and asking to go to the nurse s office when i had arrived the door was locked i remember going into the fetal position and crying at this point when the nurse finally arrived i was sent home the following day of school i had the same nauseous feeling this time the nurse had me lay down and then go back to class after a few days of the same symptoms i was not allowed to go to the nurses office anymore that is when i stopped eating to not feel ill at school this issue was only at school at first but by high school it had began to creep into every aspect of my life social family personal etc when i started working at 16 i would not eat until i got home from school work and that would be around 9pm this is also around the time when i first started approaching my parents about my problem through my parents insurance they paired me with a psychiatrist and started me on anti depressants due to my fear of vomiting being so large i could only take medicine at night i went through maybe 10 or so medicines before they told me that this is something that i just have to live with at 19 i was able to get a job with decent health care kaiser permanente initially started me with strictly meds but after a few sessions of practically begging for help they set me up with a cbt therapist the sessions generally would last an hour and would be once a week i would mention the trouble i had eating and how it was destroying my life they told me that i have an anxiety disorder and that eating was not the issue i felt like i was going insane when i had 3 different therapists tell me this 7 years later at 26 i still have the same job and i am still not eating at work my weight never went above 115 during this whole period and i am around 5 7 i looked like i was 12 13 years old i do not even want to get started about the ridicule you experience being a rail thin male with no meat on their bones during this time i also managed to get to my senior year at a university but i would do what i did in high school not eat until i got home from everything 9pm or so one night of having what felt like non stop panic for 3 days i checked myself into an er i told them that i had not eaten in 2 days and that i cannot with my phobia and that i was so afraid the nurse left and next thing i knew i was being strapped down to a gurney and they stuck me on a 51 50 this was probably one of the most traumatizing experiences of my life they initially stuck me in a room with a guy who was punching the wall all night i begged the nurse that they made a mistake and they told me to wait until morning i never felt so afraid for my life in the morning they finally told me they made a mistake and stuck me in a more secured environment before the 72 hours they ended up releasing me saying that i had no place there after this experience something strange happened within my body i do not know if it was from all the shock but when i went back to work 2 days later i saw a bagel on the counter and picked it up and ate it i felt nothing no anxiety nothing all of the sudden i was eating breakfast lunch dinner i was being social i started socially drinking too never did due to my fear it felt like something just clicked and i was fixed i was not taking any meds it was the strangest thing my weight went to 160lbs and it felt incredible and i know that there is no normal but for 1 year i felt normal it was great in 2011 i was laid off of my job with a bunch of people and this is when everything started going down hill i really cannot even recall a specific point of when things started to turn in relation to the eating but being laid off definitely kicked my anxiety back into full gear i ended up just sitting at home not eating laying in bed for hours my weight went back down to 120lbs and i ended up moving back home this was terrible since even eating around my parents is difficult with this phobia my father would get angry when i would not eat around them and it just magnified the problem after a few months i finally landed another job and moved back out with a friend after a year of not eating at work i decided to seek help again i found a place that does act therapy and exposures with eating food i initially started going going after work but it was deemed unsafe since i was not able to eat at this place i was not getting enough food so they pulled me off of work with fmla it is been 6 months since that and i have since gone back to work part time i still struggle with my panic attacks and my exposures are absolute nightmares i am on one anti depressant currently that actually worked great the first 2 months but now it feels like i am not taking anything i have had panic attacks for the last 3 days that have felt non stop i was recommended last week by my therapist to write during my panic episodes i ended up writing 22 pages of the darkest thoughts i have ever had i know this is long winded and i am sorry for all grammar errors but i really do not know where else to turn to i am ashamed to talk to family and friends because they have always been there for me and have backed me 100 getting help but when i have constant panic attacks all the time i feel like i am failing them it is tough to tell them how i am really doing thank you for anyone who took the time to read this

looking for others who have been dealing with anxiety depression panic attacks for support and reassurance that i am not alone in this would love to share stories and advice with people who are going through what i am going through i have been dealing with this for 2 years now and it came on out of the blue until just recently i have been very difficult to convince that it is just stress but after seeing a neurologist cardiologist internist opthalmologist having numerous negative test results and doing tons of research on my own i guess i need to accept that it is all in my head it is difficult because i have always considered myself someone who handles stress very well i avoid drama tackle problems logically rationally and i have never been one to sweat the small stuff looking for anyone who would be interested in sharing their experiences i am a 27 yr old woman if that matters to anyone i will not get into all my crazy symptoms just yet because i could go on forever feel free to message me privately if you prefer i could really use someone to talk to and i am also a great listener
suffering from general anxiety disorder could use some reddit support
has anyone else been prescribed remeron for gad i have tried prozac wellbutrin zoloft and then lexapro all of which caused various side effects now without seeing me my psychiatrist who does not listen to me so i am trying to replace her has switched me to remeron a drug commonly prescribed for insomnia and or depression which i do not have just looking for stories from anyone who has experience with remeron or even anyone who knows someone who does
remeron for generalized anxiety disorder feeling very nervous about this
i feel like i am becoming a hypocondriac or maybe it is a part of me that still believes my anxiety and panic attacks are something physically wrong with me however i always freak out at the slightest bump the slightest cough the slightest ache and blow them out of proportion what if i have cancer am i going to die am i going to get really sick i cannot afford getting sick does this mean therapy will not work etc all these thoughts run through my head and damn i know it is not positive does anyone else experience this
does anyone else over examine parts of their body and freak out at the slightest thing
i have been suffering for almost a month now from fairly regular panic attacks and my job has not really permitted me the time to seek help i hope to soon is there anything safe and otc herbal that works that will help
is there anything you guys use to calm down that is not prescription strength
not because i feel like i am capable of such an act but it almost drives me into panic mode thinking of the scope of human mental illness this is one of my triggers and all day today i have been reading about how this kid used to seem normal till he took a delusion turn in his late adolescence am i the only one that gets freaked out by the bizarrely large spectrum of mental illness also the media s response to this disaster has me in a frenzy but that is another story
dae get really freaked out when public displays of mental illness ie the giffords shooting seem to imply this could happen to anyone
and it is beginning to cripple me emotionally i cannot trust my body and i cannot trust my thoughts i know i should see someone but where do i start what if i have a real condition that is causing me to get these symptoms i had a blood test done at the free clinic but they said my blood is fine slightly elevated cholesterol had three ekgs since the priz angi and they are all negative anyone have similar story or advice not sure where to turn i can not get do not have insurance i do not have a lot of money
i have been getting panic attacks for ten years a heart attack prinzemetals angina four years ago has not helped the situation have never spoken with a psychiatrist about them have never been on medication long term they are happening on a daily basis now
i really do not feel like typing out my entire story again so i hope you do not mind the links to askreddit they pointed me in this direction basically i have had panic attacks and anxiety for about two years now i get really bad panic attacks once every couple months had a bad one two days ago still recovering also i am trying to figure out what to do to help my anxiety and panic attacks i would like to avoid medication if possible and from what i have seen in my family members who suffer from this they peaked around their late teens early twenties after which it dwindled down post on askreddit about my

three days with physical anxiety symptoms
do you think it is possible once you have had the experience of a panic attack to never be afraid of having one again i want to believe that can be true but unfortunately for me it is still not background i am a 22 year old who has had moderate to severe anxiety since infancy great subreddit btw
is it possible
it all started when i was in high school i have always been a bit nervous as a young boy i had severe social anxiety and hypochondria i went on medication when i was 15 until i was 17 it made the attacks stop but it made me severely depressed as a side effect my sex drive was non existent and my girlfriend at the time left me because i was a zombie it was then i realized medication was not for me i have adopted more eastern medicinal practices such as diet meditation and increased my exercise to help balance me out its been working quite well but this semester at school has been extra stressful so the attacks have been returning basically i just want someone to hear me out and maybe put in their two cents is there anyone out there who has also refused medication to take care of their problem on their own what have you substituted it with to help with the anxiety
i am a 22 year old male with generalized anxiety disorder and suffer from crippling panic attacks i have refused medication
i have a lot of bullshit going on in my life this semester has been absolute hell i had a presentation to do in class today could not make it into the building without hyperventilating i am running out of xanax and i am running out of time to make things right again next week is finals week and i do not know if i am going to be able to handle it so i am just laying in bed with a racing heart wondering how fucked i am there was no way i was going in that classroom when i could barely breathe and keep myself from having a breakdown to be honest i do not know what i expect to gain from sharing this but i need to vent to someone who understands what panicing really means
starting to choke school is becoming too much to handle
a cup of coffee and some breakfast later i find my blood trying to crawl out of my arms full on panic party of one over here ativan is not doing the trick and i am too tired from my busy week to exercise the feeling off
anxiety out of nowhere
hey panicparty i am new here and thought i had introduce myself by sharing my all time favorite panic attack last september i was riding a 20 hour train from new jersey to illinois to visit my boyfriend when the unaccountability of riding on a train alone started to get to me by the morning i had lost all the sensation in my body even my dear lady parts it did not come back for a week and i am not ticklish anymore in the next few weeks i had some minor panic attacks worrying about possibly having a similar panic attack again i had love to know if anyone s experienced anything similar or if there is anything else someone would like to share i was diagnosed with severe anxiety and ocd in april so i am finally getting good at all this
panic attack to end all panic attacks
i recently discovered this subreddit i cannot tell you how much it is helped me to read about all of you who have the same experiences as i do i do not know anyone around my town with any anxiety issues my family does not have a big history of it and frankly my husband cannot understand what i go through it is been really trying on our marriage things are looking up here in these past few months as i have really been breaking my neck trying to work on what i can and he is been working on what he can to understand my panic attacks our biggest issue is that he just cannot relate to that feeling of just knowing that you are going to die for whatever reason and the immediate regret and depression when the panic swell has passed i cried happy tears out of the relief that there are other people here that i can get help from and help out this subreddit is a lifesaver
hello panic party
i know that you are not doctors but i just want to know if i am going to die if i take some tomorrow if i need it my anxiety is bad right now i had a terrible panic attack today and i know i might flip out tomorrow so i am just wondering if i could take an ativan if it really came down to it
ran out of prescription for klonopin and forgot to pick up the new script before xmas is it safe to take ativan my sister in law has some in case of a panic attack need advice please
the literature on panic i read keeps saying one of the ways to calm yourself is to examine what s the worst that could happen that is a good question for me a panic attack is the worst thing that i will be absolutely consumed in fear and pain that my bowels will cramp i will feel faint i will be unable to do anything but spend months on my couch rocking myself and there will be no help for me what do you fear what is the worst that can happen
so for you what is the worst that could happen
so i post a decent amount on this subreddit i have been dealing with pretty bad anxiety and panic attacks for around 4 years i really thought that they came out of nowhere in my senior year of high school then they got really bad the summer after at home i thought that is where it all started i got to thinking the other night just about my past and there were a lot of clues that i never really put together that i could use an opinion on for instance from the age of 4 to around 9 or 10 years old i had to sleep in my parents room i would absolutely refuse to sleep alone in my room why at 4 i watched this show on tv that was talking about a celebrity who was shot and killed while sleeping from an intruder i do not know why but i started having absolutely horrible fears of people breaking into my house and killing me in my sleep i could not be in my room because of it i would kick and scream and cry until finally my parents gave in could this have been the start of everything or just me wanting to believe so i also got massive stomach aches whenever i would go out of town with my dad when i was younger i just played it off as not feeling well but when i would come home i had be fine eventually i just stopped leaving because i knew i would have a stomach ache and i would anticipate it before even leaving
could i have shown anxiety at a young age
i am a panic disorder and gad sufferer for around the last 3 or so years i am currently not on any medication and my anxiety comes and goes some days i will feel fine while others i feel like complete garbage for the last 2 days my anxiety has been through the roof i am naseous i feel groggy as hell my nose and eyes are itchy i get a headache here and there and my heart rate is fast here and there as well as me getting sweaty palms i have come to realize that my anxiety peaks at very predictable times of the year i first started having my bad anxiety attacks around june 20th of 2009 i had another bad episode last year around july 2nd now i am having it again at nearly the same time i also have bad allergies to grass and weed pollen which according to the weather channel just started to peak in my area my dad has really bad allergies to the stuff as well and it is a pretty miserable time i never thought that both could be connected i am not saying that pollen is causing my anxiety but is there a possibility that it is aggravating it beyond normal levels anyone else experiencing something like this and what could help it all started after i went on a bike ride around my neighborhood outside for around an hour since then i have felt like garbage when i go outside
allergies and anxiety gad
it all started here now the anxious mind is like an undisciplined child if you decide she needs to go to bed at 8pm after years of letting her stay awake and do whatever she wanted she will not like it it will be weeks of reinforcement and difficulty but in the end she will obey so with our minds the stimulus comes for panic tiny almost invisible a smell a memory a question you mind recognizes the fear and begins to charge down a path with which it is most familiar where there is least resistance panic you cannot control what jumps into your head but it is up to you whether or not it dances there i will step in front of my mind as it barrells down the path toward familiar pain i will stop gently i will remove it and place it where it needs to be instead no need to dwell on how horrible it was last year do not poke your wound instead the sun it turns my skin a rich tan and fuels my garden the heat allows my little ones to splash in a wading pool and create happy summer memories the smell of grass is a lush lawn to stretch out on and the pain of last year i had to go through it to get my jack the fat sweet thing next to me that was then this is now my mind is my own tool i control it not the other way around i breathe
so what am i gonna do about it
my wife has had anxiety issues for over a year now and they seem to be getting worse she has several panic attacks a month she has been talking about finding a therapist for several months now and has done some research on some however she feels a great deal of anxiety about finding the right one and figuring out the logistics she also wants to start exercising as she has heard that can improve anxiety however she hasn t and continues to beat herself up about that talking about her anxiety can give her panic attacks as well she has asked me to help her figure out what to do as she has not been able to take control of this as she does with other things my question is what can i do to help how can i best help any advice you have on what i can do
wife with anxiety how can i help
i started taking zoloft yesterday for my panic anxiety disorder and i have been experiencing weird sensations in my body which as an extremely anxious person is very unnerving my sight feels trembly and i cannot focus well my head starts spinning when i walk i feel as if i weighed a thousand pounds and i feel very weak i also feel very trembly is it normal has anyone experienced similar effects and did the zoloft help you
experiences with zoloft
what do you guys think of the idea that us as humans have the ability to delve into innate skillsets and that fear is just one of them someone who delves into fear will be skilled at experiencing it they will experience anxiety be experts in panic or fight flight someone who delves into music will be skilled in that if we learn to delve into other areas of live in the same way perhaps we can crawl our way out of the black hole of anxiety
fear expertise and the illusion that fear is what we are best at

you really should be working on that big essay that is due friday
what the fuck am i so afraid of
i sat in a room with two girls last night for around 45 minutes and said not one word
i considered making a fake account for this but what the hell long and short of it is i work two jobs neither are really stressful except that before i had these two jobs i had one and it was a nightmare because a harassment issue got the owner s son fired he harassed me calling me gay faggot etc in front of coworkers and customers often and now i suffer from stomach uneasiness as i go to work it is not pain it is not painful and it does not make me want to throw up so it is not making me nauseous i m a bit of a hypochondriac constantly analyzing my symptoms and whatnot it helps when i look at a huge list of symptoms for things and notice that i do not have a physical disease it just wrenches and gurgles in my stomach when i think of all the terrible things it could do to my body and health it makes me worry more how can i beat this i am in between health coverage right now and i am afraid of the cost of counselling and such any good at home remedies
i frequently suffer from anxiety related uneasiness in my stomach i do not know what to do
i have procrastinated through my good days and bad days in hopes that my anxiety and bad panic attacks will get better i keep getting called a hypocondriac and at 20 years old i already have pattern baldness do not know if this is from the stress or family but it is terrible looking either way i have been putting off seeing a doctor or a therapist for a few years i have never really been on medication long term for this but it is effected me a lot i have had to drop out of school early got my diploma though cannot apply for college lost my job etc i spend most of my days playing minecraft or other computer games to distract myself i am getting more bad days closer together and good days further apart i have tried to start my own business and get another job but could not go through with it because of my anxiety i know it is stupid to ask and the rational person would get help but i cannot help but feel pushed away from it i feel like i will be missing out on something if i go on medication or i could get worse i also do not have health insurance so i will be going to a walk in clinic i am going back to a therapist though and having it paid for but that is not til the end of next month i am debating going to the walk in clinic tomorrow as i feel like this is getting worse can i get some advice guys
anyone else fear getting help or getting on medication

25 stories of panic attacks and living with anxiety
my doctor keeps suggesting different medication for my anxiety but i am sick of being on pills he put me on xanax at 14 but i stopped taking it not long after my doctor recently put me on paxil at 17 which i had a bad experience with and am now off of it i do not want to take medication like this anymore afraid of it making me feel like crap becoming dependent on it or having bad withdrawals from it so my question is is there any kind of natural medicines that i could buy locally that seem to help with anxiety
any suggestions on natural medicines for anxiety
i have been battling gad for about 2 years now and have taken many different medications my gp prescribed ssri s at first zoloft lexapro and presiq i really hated taking them awful side effects including increased anxiety sexual problems brain zaps etc after about a year of taking these drugs my gp referred me to a psychiatrist the first thing my new pdoc wanted me to be on was prozac he explained that prozac is the best at treating gad due to its long half life i told him about the awful side effects from the other ssri s so instead of prozac he put me on buspar it worked for awhile and was for the most part side effect free but over time i had to constantly increase the dose was taking up to 90mg a day with little benefit my pdoc again wanted to put me on prozac which i again told him about my past experiences with ssri s so he put me on klonopin 1mg a day and all was well for well over 5 months with no side effects today was my 3 month check up and i was telling him that my anxiety has been getting increasingly worse he once again asked about my ssri past which i told him again instead of increasing the dose of klonopin which i figured he would do he insisted we tried prozac i made it clear to him about my feelings on ssri s but he said not to worry it will work he prescribed me 20mg to start and said that he will probably increase the dose to 40mg after a couple of weeks anyways sorry for the long rant i am now taking prozac and was wondering if any of you are taking it and how it makes you feel is prozac really a miracle drug for gad like my pdoc seems to think and should i expect the same nasty side effects as i have with zoloft and lexapro tl dr my psych put me on prozac for gad how does it work for you all who are currently taking it
what are your thoughts on prozac fluoxetine
it is the way the air smells in spring the way the sunlight hits the road outside my house the sound of the lawnmowers in the distance the heat coming on last year is coming back i spent a spring and summer prostrate with panic that chewed me up every day i was also pregnant and could not take medication to mediate the pain so every day it came i laid on my brown couch curled up i shook my left leg to rock myself for hours i lost so much weight when i was supposed to be gaining there was no escape no safe place no help for me fall came i took medication when my first trimester ended but not nearly as much as i thought i needed things got better manageable the baby came and i loved him the panic faded to ghosts and now here it is again despite the medication sitting on my lawn stinking of cut grass disgusting bird song sickly acid yellow sunlight i cannot eat my bowels will not hold together and stomach hurts from the acid churning in it i am so scared that is the bad part i am going to make another post with the good part the plan the truth
first catharsis in honesty to people who get it
i fucking hate google let me start off with that i fucking hate google because i will google the craziest shit in the world because it happened to me and is something i have not noticed this is about to get kinda graphic sorry for example just now i googled dark stool seeing as i just had a rather interesting excursion it did not hurt it was actually quite relieving but it was oddly dark so i decided hah would not it be a lark to google this and see what the cause of it is big mistake google flipped through some pages thoughtfully and said welp it could be that there is too much sodium and not enough veggies in your diet given that i am a heavy salt user and the only veggies i normally eat are potatoes and lettuce or black tar like stool could be a symptom of internal bleeding caused by an ulcer hey you have stress issues at work right maybe this is why your stomach hurt in brief stressful periods these past couple of days hmm maybe that right at which point i felt a familiar cold tingling enter my extremities fear god stupid fucking fear then fast breathing and suddenly my eyes felt frantic like they were going to bug out of my head i had to focus and breathe deep to calm myself down and remind myself that it is more than likely the cause of my poor diet and that my stool was not black and tarry it was just dark brown end gross stuff here i am still trembling and the doctor isnt a possibility i know logically that i am fine all signs point to it and yet the possibility feels as real as a car barreling towards me tl dr googled half symptom got full panic over what is probably nothing god i hate how my brain works
trying to avoid a relapse into serious anxiety and panic please help
doctors have diagnosed me with anxiety and i find that trying to search for similar symptoms can be futile many people have panic attacks and anxiety symptoms but they can sometimes be totally different from what i am experiencing i thought creating a post where anyone can go to find symptoms similar to their own would not only be helpful to me but to others looking for assurance please post as many descriptive experiences as possible as in do not say i felt bad but say exactly the physical and mental symptoms experienced i will describe my own experience below
describe your panic attacks anxiety symptoms in full detail here
has it helped you i have had a couple panic attacks in the last year and my cousin who is a nurse gave me about half her bottle of welbutrin i cannot tell if it is making a difference or not yet but i know that i still get anxious i had a panic attack last week or so so maybe not i do not know someone help i wish this would just go away
has anyone ever taken welbutrin for anxiety
just a curious question i do not want any thoughts on the consequences of smoking i am just curious how many of you do smoke cigarettes for your anxiety and panic does it help every forum and place that i have heard of considers nicotine as something that makes anxiety worse does it help anyone i do see a lot of stressed people smoking i know it is not healthy yet again just a hypothetical
anxiety nicotine
i have told myself over and over that i should get help but i am still hesitant why i do not know i guess that by getting help i feel like i have failed somehow i am terrified of getting on medication because i fear that if something happens i will not be able to control it even though i have really bad panic attacks i know it is my body creating them not any medication this probably does not make much sense i am going to make an appointment to see a therapist tomorrow my question is has anyone beaten their anxiety if so how do you do it today was particularly pretty bad for me and so i spent most of my day sitting in front of my computer using video games to take my mind off of being anxious i went outside and took a short walk for a bit but that is about it it is getting harder to leave my house and i fear that i will never be the way i was i fear that i will not be able to enjoy going places or hanging out with friends or experiencing new areas like i used to i fear those things now i am sure i will be told i need to get help and i do want to i am just curious of anyone s opinion as well
has anyone beaten this on their own
trying to figure out my life and schedule and what i am doing and will i have plans this weekend i know its all part of social anxiety but i could really really use some tips really
dae get anxiety about making plans or other social anxiety discussion
hello again i may be posting a little too much it is just that i have done really nothing today and have had a lot of time to think about my anxiety depression and life in general i formulated a plan for the next month for myself this is all based around opinions from various people and thoughts pertaining to lowering my anxiety and agoraphobia i will follow a couple of basic steps for the next month and see how my anxiety improves if it does not by the end then i will seek medical help for my symptoms first step spending less time on the computer i currently spend anywhere from 10 12 hours in front of my computer per day especially now that i do not have a job anymore the computer has become my main hideaway and distraction i believe too much of it is causing my dizziness and worsening my anxiety and depression second step exercise this one is simple but will be difficult to get into a routine with i enjoy biking especially trails i plan on doing some form of cardio exercise for at least one hour per day this all stems from the fact that i feel my happiest when i have worn myself out during the summer i went on a family vacation one the beach for a week strait during that time i was in the water 8 hours a day and never that incredible in years my appetite was amazing and my mood was fantastic i hope to attain that again through exercise step 3 eating and sleeping better currently i wake up around 1030 or 11 and eat a small unhealthy breakfast followed by an upset stomach and around 1 or 2 i will eat a decent lunch etc i end up snacking a lot at night and fall asleep around 2 or 3 i would like to start eating more balanced meals and eating larger during the earlier hours of the day i will have to start going to sleep and getting up earlier which i believe the exercise will help me with wearing me out snacking late at night does not help my stomach aches in the morning either that is my plan the only hard part is sticking to it for the next month what do you think
my plan for the next month
this may seem a bit contradictory to a lot of people s opinions but is anyone else like me afraid to seek help with their anxiety i have been to a couple months of cbt which helped for a while but inevitably my anxiety came back i lost my job to my panic attacks and suffer from daily stress and anxiety to the point where my mind is constantly racing i suffer from occasional dizzy spells and am fearing that since i lost my job i am getting more and more afraid of leaving my house i do not have health insurance so seeing a psychiatrist is pretty much out of the question i am forced to go to medical or mental health clinics around my area i am afraid of being labeled as a nutcase and also i am afraid of getting on medication i have heard from different people all over that since they have been on theirs it has drastically helped them i am just afraid that if i do get on something i am worried it could change me for the worse at least when i have panic attacks and anxiety now i know that it is my sober body doing it to me once i get on medication i am weary of the potential side effects and problems that could arise from it is this an illegitimate fear i mean after all i guess if it got too bad i could just get off of it opinions anyone
anyone else afraid to seek help
so i have had these vertigo attacks from what i can remember i have had about 8 or 9 of them over the last couple years afterwards i am usually a little dizzy for a week or two after them my last one was about a week ago most of them have happened while at the computer but two happened when i was outside basically what happens is that i feel like someone is pushing me or turning my head to the left really quick sometimes my ear will start ringing as well then i will get extremely dizzy for a few seconds and i will be thrown immediently into a panic attack has this happened to anyone else i think it is a main problem with my anxiety and i do not know if it is causing it or a product of anxiety

hello everyone again so i have decided i am going to try and see a doctor tomorrow i have made an appt to see a therapist but it is not until the 17th of march the last few days i have been feeling really dizzy and lightheaded i do not know if this has anything to do with my anxiety or not but the feeling of having it does make me anxious this has happened a couple times in the past since i have had my anxiety basically what happens everytime is that i will be doing something sitting in front of my computer or my friend driving me home the last two times and it will feel like someone started pushing my head over like my vision would twist and it would feel like i am falling to the side or falling over as soon as this would happen i would be thrown into an intense panic attack and i would be dizzy for the rest of the day or even the rest of the week like the last two times my problem is that i have gone to the doctor for this last time ears checked out ok i was told it could be an inner ear infection i got better eventually the only blood test i have had was to check out my thyroid level which turned out high but still in the normal levels i have been told before that my panic attacks and anxiety depression from them is just panic disorder and usually was given paxil or prozac which i have not taken when i go tomorrow should i tell the doctor everything that is been going on should i ask for a blood test or something of the sort i know i may sound like a hypochondriac but i am extremely scared that there is something wrong with me i also do not have health insurance so the consequence of me being extremely sick frightens me as well i guess i am ranting now what do you guys think
seeing a doctor tomorrow
i have suffered anxiety and panic attacks on a regular basis since the day i turned 20 literally that very day began a panic attack that lasted a whole week and prevented me from leaving my bed almost entirely the main trigger has always been fear of heart issues any time i had have a little flutter or notice it was beating stronger and faster than i thought it should be at that point in time i had become anxious then the symptoms would grow from the anxiety and feed itself until it became panic this happened constantly endlessly almost daily lately over the past 6 months i have finally been overcoming them and now i am at the point where i almost never get a heart related anxiety issue i have brought it completely under control although i still have a few other anxiety triggers i have a phobia of vomiting so things like acid reflux and indigestion are very strong triggers and i get those a lot i have managed to almost completely eliminate my fear of heart problems as a trigger today is the first day in a long time that i have had an anxiety attack related to my fear of heart problems my heart has been feeling strange since 4pm and it is now 3am it feels like there is a giant air pocket filling my chest cavity where my heart should be though i am extremely aware of my heart beat it almost feels as if it is weak and tired i have managed to hold back the anxiety attack all this time expecting the symptom to go away eventually as i convince myself that it is nothing to be afraid of and that nothing is actually wrong with me but it is not going away and now i am worried i can feel a self feeding anxiety attack ready to pounce on me i am not going to look up these symptoms on the google machine because we all know exactly what will happen panic will be inevitable i will be convinced i have cancer heart failure and am having a stroke all at once and panic will ensue instantaneously my concern is that this symptom is just not going away it is almost been 12 hours what on earth should i do
so i have been making amazing progress in getting over the majority of my anxiety attacks but right at this moment i am having an attack that seems impossible to stop
hello wonderful people of reddit i hope i am in the right place i need some opinions so as the title says i have been having chronic dizziness before i give a little background on myself i want to say that when this bout of dizziness started i immediately went to doctors and found out that nothing is physically wrong with me medically i am perfectly healthy i am a college student that took a semester off in the fall i get great grades do not do drugs hang out with great people and overall have not run into any trouble i am usually a positive and outgoing person but those few months off from school changed me i lived at home with my parents from september to january which is when my chronic dizziness started my home is unstable and my parents are both bipolar and controlling my parents marriage is far from happy and the only time they do not fight is when they join forces to abuse me they are very sure that i am wrapped up in the drug scene and that i party my life away at school some nights they stayed up and watched me because they thought i was strung out on drugs once again no drugs here they threatened to put me in community college to watch me if i ever came home a few minutes later than my curfew they screamed for hours and said i was such a disappointment and an overall bad kid on multiple occasions my dad has shouted demeaning things at me for no reason and hit me it s not ok to hit your kids anymore when they are in their 20s they are very paranoid people when i get upset over what they say they act like they never said anything they deny all of the abuse that they just threw at me they also have no idea why i get upset and deny all of their verbal abuse sometimes things just go right back to normal after they have accused me of being a drug addict and a failure many more things have happened but these are some examples my parents have made me uncomfortable in my own house and even in my own skin in just a few months i have never had any anxiety problems but this abuse from my parents caused me to have a decent amount of anxiety in november i started to get dizzy every day to the point where i could not drive anywhere as i said before i went to doctors and got many tests that concluded that i was perfectly healthy once i moved out to go to school for this spring semester my dizziness went away the physical problem that was interfering with my life simply evaporated which i was okay with i was just happy that it was finally gone and i was happy to be away from my household however now when i come home on the weekends for local job obligations the dizziness returns my relationship with my parents is now civil but my issues with them were never really resolved they are still bipolar and abusive to each other but not me could it be that this dizziness returns simply because i am back in my house could just sitting in my house subconsciously cause anxiety which makes me dizzy short version college student that does not get into trouble took semester off and lived with verbally abusive parents developed chronic dizziness physically healthy went away to school dizziness went away came back home and got dizzy again can just being in my house alone cause me to be dizzy which means that my dizziness is anxiety i am too broke to afford therapy myself so i would really love to get some opinions thanks reddit

herbal supplements for anxiety x post from r anxiety
lately i have been having some overwhelming anxiety i used to have it a lot but then when i got really busy i no longer had time to feel it after the last two months becoming extremely stressful i noticed its crept back into my life right now i have bad overwhelming anxiety it feels like my entire chest has tightened i am very dreadful terrified that something is going to happen to me these bouts of anxiety i think are related to noticeable sleep apnea conditions before i fall asleep i wake up with a fright or like i need to breath it takes a long time to fall asleep when this happens i usually wake up with terrible anxiety i have to wake up in 3 hours and on top of that work fairly late today is there anybody out there that can just set me straight
overwhelming anxiety
it is not bad but noticeable i will notice everyonce in a while usually during times of being really anxious my vision kind of shakes it will feel as though when something is stationary it is moving a little or jittery i do not know if it is my eyes because i am anxious or maybe it is just due to the fact that i spend a lot of time on the computer i also wear glasses if this helps
does anyone else have distorted vision with their anxiety
hi everyone i just found this subreddit and figured it might be a place to vent some of my feelings and prove to myself that i am not crazy i have had three major episodes of panic anxiety attacks in my life where an episode is a series of the attacks that lasts for several days or weeks i have been anxious for a couple days all day today and had a full blown attack earlier so i fear i might be slipping back into another episode is not it insidious how the fear of having the attacks makes you have them anyway just wondered if anyone out there is had the same experiences when i get attacks i feel really cold feel like i cannot breathe my mind starts racing usually a xanax helps calm that down but the one i took earlier is not doing much so far i read somewhere that it can take a few doses of it to really get control of yourself back i hope its not long is this true i do not really know what this post is for other than to just get it out there thanks for listening
here we go again
i usually feel as if the inside of my skin is burning or cold as well it usually lasts a couple of seconds also i feel tingling or small waves of electricity in my head arms legs hands and last but not least i have been feeling a very annoying pressure in my head and when i walk i feel really weird as if my body was very weak and i could fall any minute does anyone else experience things like these
dae feel cold hot flashes in random body parts tingling and general body weakness

the old world wrecked havoc on the new world by the spread of diseases i get that europeans had a lot of diseases that the natives had not been exposed to but would not that work the other way too my understanding is that because they lived more sparsely disease was less rampant but i still feel like there would have been some diseases europeans had not seen before
why did europeans spread their diseases to native americans but not vice versa

the most obvious example is the european domination of the native americans however i want to know of different instances of this behavior between civilizations i would prefer an example with the aggressor being a non european people my motivation for asking this stems from my observation that this behavior is commonly attributed to europeans and not other races at least in my experience and i would like to know if this is a phenomenon that has occurred between non european people as well edit the amount of feedback and great answers i have gotten is astonishing and i had like to thank everyone who has contributed but it seems like i worded this is a confusing way i did not mean simply examples of conquest and warfare in which a civilization dominates another but rather the outright annihilation and suppression of a civilization and culture that would compare to the downfall of the native americans i apologize for not being more specific
what is an example of a stronger more advanced civilization dominating a weaker less advanced civilization through violent and even genocidal means
i have done a lot of research into this and it seems like frameworks for how tribes interact with the state generally subscribe to what ibn khaldun said that they rebel when a central state is strong and submit when it is weak lots of historians and political scientists have tried to expand on that further i was wondering if anyone knew of a particular text or author that had a compelling theory which supported or disagreed with that point of view
how did tribes interact with the state in the arab world historically or in modern times

i have read a few different stories about how similar latin and the language of the gauls was how did 2 seemingly unrelated languages come to be so similar i assumed it was because they are both close enough to proto indo european to have lots of similarities and chance geography did the rest was i far off

hello in paintings and photographs of soldiers specifically officers i have noticed that they carried a sword the 1800 and 1900 s were well into the age of gunpowder so my question is how effective were these swords in combat against rifles how often were they actually used in battle rather than for ceremonies why did not officers have long rifles like their enlisted counterparts and when did officer s decide swords were useless on the field of battle answers will be appreciated very much gators edit i should also add when exactly did officer s begin to use rifles more
question swords on the battlefields of the 1800 1900s

sorry for the title gore but this has been bothering me for a while and i wanted to be as clear as possible as far as i know all imperial courts have been rife with people deceiving and screwing over one another in the search for power but i have not been able to find a word phrase that encapsulated this the best example i can give is the modern english phrase a game of thrones which has been used in this context in popular media because of the hbo show s popularity and was not used before 2010 according to google trends
did any major empire in history have a word or phrase that encapsulated the phenomena of many different people in a court vying for each other s high ranking titles such as lord or king
i remember hearing how bloody some of these wars were and i was just think about how we do not really think about anything bad happening to us until it actually does is there actually a statistical probability describing how likely it would be for someone joining to military then that they would die lets say i am in the us how does the probability here compare to other countries
if i joined the military in wwi wwii what would the probability be that i would not be coming home

i am curious as to the distinction between irish culture and religion compared to other ancient civilizations such as ancient britain ireland from my understanding has always been the island of the celts however caesar describes differing tribes in the gaelic region france as including the celts among many others this does not make sense in the modern conventional use of the celts unless there is a large unified tribe extending from ireland to france is there a definitive cultural boundary for ireland i am especially interested in religious traditions personally but anything you guys know regarding my question would be fantastic thank you

chernobyl and fukashima are the worlds two worst nuclear disasters both rating at level 7 s according to the i n e s and reminded us why nuclear reactors are a dangerous source of energy but if someone asked what is the third someone would probably say i do not know and i do not blame them i am posting this to stop that post this is the story of the kyshtym disaster to get a understanding of the importance of the area you have to have a basic understanding of the cold war and mayak the cold war was a consequence of the second world war its all very debatable and this is very basic background information because it left two super powers the us and ussr both wanting to rebuild war torn germany unfortunately the us is capitalist and the ussr is communist they would then go on for decades fighting a war with no battles an arms race for nuclear power and space mayak was one of the biggest nuclear facilities in russia at the time known as chelyabinsk 40 and was incredibly secret towns were built nearby like ozyorsk also known as city 40 this city was the home to all the staff who work at mayak and the children who grew up there went even told why it was so secret the city even had checking systems and soldiers around the city the disaster was called the kyshtym disaster because kyshtym was the nearest town which was not secret mayak was dumping nuclear waste into the techa river which went into the river ob and then the arctic ocean for open air storage this dumping had horrible effects on the local environment and villagers on the 29th of september 1957 after about 10 years of covert work a underground cooling system which contained about 70 80 tonnes of dangerous radioactive waste failed it was not repaired this resulted in a huge chemical explosion with a force around 70 100 tonnes of t n t although the actual explosion did not kill anyone it realized a huge radioactive cloud which travelled 20 thousand square kilometres this is were it got bad for russia over ten thousand people were evacuated from the area but this took anywhere from 3 11 years this was because of the huge secrecy behind mayak and the near towns 22 towns villages where exposed to the radiation and a large area of the environment was poisoned the result on the people was horrible to say the least leukemia rates went up and stomach cancer was two or three times greater than in survivors of nagasaki or hiroshima because not many people new about the effects of radiation when the sighs hit people panicked skin was said to be sloughing of peoples faces and other parts of there body but even now the effects can still be seen survivors normally do not live into the 50 s and their children suffer diseases and malformations from birth even though the ussr tried to keep mayak a secret the cia still new about it fortunately for the ussr the cia also decided to keep it secret no one really knows why they did decided not to tell anyone but one of the most popular theories are that they did not want to insight fear in the us they had there own nuclear research and they would have the own disasters this took me a long time to write and a lot of research if i misspelt any of the names i am sorry i am not a professional historian just incredibly interested in the cold war and hope to do more of these in the future i would also love to discuss in the comments whether you think the cia did the right thing your views on the secrecy whether the ussr should have kept it secret etc i would even love it if you corrected me so i could edit it into the post thanks for reading

i have to say about 90 of all western films and tv shows i have seen depict it as this savage place filled with violence debauchery and all kinds of uncivilized behavior pulling from your knowledge of the history of the american west is this fairly accurate or is this an extreme media cultural exaggeration as usual
was the old american west nearly as savage as shown on tv
i know the first one broke down and had to be replaced however i could not find anything on what happened to the 2nd one did it just fall into disuse if so is it still usable furthermore why did they just abandon it if it was abandoned to me it does not make sense that they built this massive cable that was a joint european and american effort that was hailed as the technological innovation of the day and then suddenly abandoned without any sort of fanfare and faded into the halls of time
what happened to the transatlantic cable
americans had been using lever action rifles through their civil war and the wild west period yet europeans used single shot breechloaders that while doing lots of damage to the individual strikes me as less useful when you want to conquer a portion of a continent as fast as possible why did they not use them at least at a large extent
why did europeans use breechloading rifles instead of lever action rifles in their conquest of africa through the late 1800s
europe first was a strategy in which the us and the uk promised to use most of their forces to fight germany first but when the us entered world war ii they concentrated most of their forces on fighting japan until the invasion of normandy in 1944 why was this
despite the europe first strategy why did the us send most of it is forces to the pacific first during wwii
this is one of those things that has bothered me for years but i have never really delved too deeply into finding an answer from the very little i know about japan i had expect the tiny island nation that has repeatedly been on the wrong side of history to be an incredibly weak world power but they are not from a primarily eurocentric educational perspective whenever i hear anything about japanese history it usually begins with someone mentioning the samurai then maybe a mention of picking the wrong side in wwii then getting nuked twice and then spontaneously springing up everywhere in the 80s before slipping into a less dominant but still substantial world position today so my question is why is japan one of the world s more powerful economies militaries and tech hubs when the only things i ever hear about related to japanese history tend to be bad things
how has japan risen to be one of the most powerful nations in the world
i have often been wondering as i have been reading more and more about medieval infantry what exactly did people wear when they did not have full plate armor because to my understanding not everyone could afford full plate armor and very few armies were actually completely clad in full plate i think people wore gambesons and mail or both when they did not have the luxury of full plate its just that everytime i play a video game or roleplay theres always going to be a group of thugs or mercenaries who all wear leather armor and from what i have been told leather armor was simply not as prevalent as hollywood makes it out to be studded leather armor was supposedly nonexistent as well so what would be a cheap or suitable historically accurate armor set that would constitute as light or medium style armor edited i also was interested to know what was worn with gambesons
what constitutes as light or medium style armor

did soldiers who died in battle or war any wars know they were going to die or all thought they had be the lucky ones to survive
it seems to be a social contruct it mainly leads to a double standard when it comes to guys girls sleeping with somebody logically it does not make any sense why it would be morally wrong for a girl not to be pure or for her to be straight foward or hook up when a its okay for a guy to do it 1 when did this start 2 why did it happen i figured the historians would know if it is in human nature or if it was a social construct based on their findings
when why did virginity purity become an important value for women in human history
in studying china in college most reads relating to japan were relegated to the relationship of the two countries and the effect of the meiji restoration on qing dynasty china other books i have come across attempt to sum up too much history far too quickly for instance contemporary to ancient in 200 pages i would like to delve deeper into pre restoration history any suggestions would be greatly appreciated

almost every army used them but i cannot get a straight answer as to why i have found half a dozen different answers none of which seems to make sense wikipedia says for comfort and support others say to protect the shins to prevent being caught on barbed wire to keep boots laced or help boots fit better none of those answers really make sense they obviously had some purpose or they would not have been so widely adopted but after ww1 they were suddenly abandoned for normal pant legs

in our modern day it seems like it is really competitive being to be an officer in the us or british military i was an enlisted infantry soldier in the us military and most of my pls platoon leaders came from west point a very hard military school to get into or had awards that made them highly distinguished like a ranger tab it seems like it is very competitive to be an officer was it as competitive during wwi and wwii when more soldiers were needed did those that had bachelors degrees automatically made them officers what was the process of soldiers becoming an officer back then what was the process to be a fighter pilot during the wwi and wwii being a fighter pilot now is very competitive its pretty much akin to wanting to be a movie star an out of reach goal for most people i could not find a lot information that satisfied my questions i appreciate your time in replying back thanks

history is full of examples of cities being sacked whether its by bashful barbarians jaded jihadists conquering crusaders nonsensical nomads so on and so forth but what exactly happens during a sack rome seemed to have been sacked multiple times but there are still ancient buildings standing to this day constantinople was sacked but it still remained one of the most important centres of the world what happens during a sack how come people still live in the city after a sacking is it just because these cities are normally important areas for large populations what do the conquerors do to the people living in the city and how does a city pick itself back up any examples of considerations that conquerors might have had before burning the place down if burnings occurred how much destruction is considered for a sack or is the term used too liberally to pin down throughout history

i just do not understand what the point of it was i mean i could understand it if it was putting people who were born in japan and lived a while there and then moved to the states i would not agree with it but it had be understandable considering what was going on but if someone was born in america grew up there and viewed it as their true home but happened to have japanese parents or heritage why throw them into a camp too if they were born in america and grew up the american way then why would you assume that they had be loyal to hirohito or japan when they were never indoctrinated
in world war 2 why were people who were born in america but had japanese heritage put into internment camps

what was an overall view of china in the early 18th century
the wikipedia pages on the matter still fail to clarify some points when i first thought about it i wondered does a retreating force present its back to the enemy probably not all at once i presume i get the impression that an orderly retreat was performed company by company with the mass of the army holding their ground while only the company whose turn it was would move towards the rear i am also curious about the order in which sections of the army would retreat would the units nearest to the enemy be the first to retreat or the last while the units are moving away from the battlefield are not they vulnerable to an enemy charge how do you adequately cover them without risking the loss of the covering units
what exactly constitutes an orderly retreat in the pre rifle gunpowder era

here s the text in russian the source is listed as a book published in russia in the 1990s so although it might be taken with a grain of salt overall style seems to fit to teacher comrade martyshin i have received your letter about escapades of vasily stalin thank you for the letter replying with a great delay because of being overloaded with work my apologies vasily is a spoiled young man of average abilities little wildman not always honest likes to blackmail weak teachers not rarely an insolent fellow with weak or more accurately unorganized willpower he was spoiled by various god fathers and god mommies who continually emphasize that he is stalin s son i am glad that in your person there is at least one self respecting teacher who treats vasily as everyone else and demands that the insolent boy follows the school s policy vasily is spoiled by principals like the one you mentioned washcloth people means spinless in rus who have no place at school and if insolent vasily has not destroyed himself yet it is because our country still has teachers who do not give slack to the little young swell my advice demand stricter from vasily and do not be affraid of fake blackmail threats of suicide from the capricious child you will have my support unfortunately i do not have the opportunity to fuss with vasily myself but promise to grab him by the collar from time to time cheers edit vasily was born in 1921 so he was 17 in 1938 edit 2 comments say that washcloth can be translated as wet rag or limp rag it does seem to sound better

sometimes it is really interesting to me when maybe looking at a field or something void of man made things that that is exactly how the ancient world would have looked full of color vibrant and alive even people too sometimes i will see someone and they just look like they could have been born 2000 years ago and vice verse if you took any person from years ago but they were born today perhaps snatched an ancient roman right as they were born they would fit in just fine maybe they had love video games love cars and perhaps be no different from your average man seeing black and white photographs whose quality gets worse the further back in time you go gives a false perception of the world look outside that is what it looked like not some grainy greyscale world this is also why i love seeing colorized photgraphs it just seems to add another layer of realness to it edit wow so i read through all the comments and it brought up some more interesting points how much do you know about your great great grandfather do you even know what he looks like with today s technology our great ancestors hundreds of years in the future will see our life in hd or perhaps hd will seem unimaginable unsophisticated but my ancestors in 500 years could see videos of me with friends making dumb home videos laughing into the camera playing sports and they could see the great leaders and events today 9 11 will probably be taught in history class for hundreds of years they will not just read out of a text book though they will see the videos

i just had a pretty long involved conversation with someone and i have to share it somehow why not the history sub today he works at a gas station that nearly shares a parking lot with my job i am night shift obviously since it is 0530 and so is he he is gassing up my truck and i asked about his accent i am interested in the world so it was a friendly question he is turkish but lived in kazak ssr in the ussr he was drafted into the red army 1983 1986 as a grunt infantrymen guard i am a us army vet my dad was in the marines in the 80 s and some of his stories make me realize how much the military has changed in just 30 years but this man s story made it seem like we were recounting world war two conditions basic training was relatively short as he had a para military education in high school his job he was not specific on a job title such as a us army mos he did say guard but was not military police training was ojt at his unit there would be a squad of new guys who were hazed tormented shown the ropes by the rest of the company he stayed in the kazak region for this period and his units purpose was to guard a center for radiation i dug at that and i think it was either a nuclear weapons site research site or test site which used army soldiers as physical security gate guards they checked id s roved the perimeter and held exercises on the immediately adjacent grounds he had an rpg 7 but never fired it there was never a rocket available they did have ammunition for makarov pistols and ak47 rifles no heavy weapons of any kind this was a cake assignment and the men knew it moral was so so boredom was the worst enemy they lived on site the workers lived on site the necessary civilians lived on site it was almost a prison environment the nearest town was many hours drive away but hardly anyone got to visit for any reason this is not the hell part yet after 1 year his unit was suddenly tasked to go to latvia region for a war exercise like a force on force war game keep in mind these are 90 simple kazak draftees who have been sitting on their butts for years with no real weapons no real training or experience and suddenly they are under the microscope for an exercise they were given all officers who had been to afghanistan but none of the enlisted men had been they were utterly destroyed by the opposing force and made complete fools of themselves there were even fatal accidents one man accidentally shot one of the senior inspectors with his rifle a tank had rolled over some men in a ditch and killed them a man was crushed between two trucks several men were injured as they were made to crawl over or under barbed wire with real explosives going off next to them these were flares meant to simulate artillery but were powerful enough to burn due to their big fat failure on this exercise they went to the ussr turkey border as guards to a penal unit of military prisoners this was punishment for the entire unit and all its mid and higher level ncos and officers were stripped of rank and they served together as grunts with a new cadre of officers assigned to them this is where the real hell started keep in mind these are the guards not the prisoners themselves they were on near starvation rations those who did not steal from the local populace would go hungry they would steal from each other they were beaten by their superiors threatened with court martial if they made any simple mistake there were political officers at this unit and any denunciation could send you to siberia or literally to death some men were executed for voicing concerns that they would starve to death on the issued rations not on the spot but tried in court found guilty and then executed by firing squad in winter several men did die of exposure many more prisoners died of over work on construction projects starvation disease and exposure this man started losing teeth his hair was falling out and even his nails were getting brittle and breaking sometimes the prisoners would attack the guards his friend was hit in the head with a shovel and killed in front of him he was attacked and stabbed several times he said the prisoners were mostly thugs and mentally unstable who had been drafted committed crimes in the military and sentenced to build roads or similar for life he did participate in some prisoner beat downs but he says he did not kill anybody a form of punishment was to tie up a prisoner naked and pour boiling water on him with a drinking cup then vodka over the wound it was like a prison war within a military one day his time was up he was discharged on the spot at the station where he was serving but his train pass was not for his home city the authorities decided he should now live in a city elsewhere in the country a soviet citizen was not allowed to decide where to call home apparently he was assigned a job in industry it was already arranged for him rather than this he used his knowedge of the border area to escape into turkey he was a turk after all he lived there for years before emigrating to the us and now he pumps gas at night i know dictatorship militaries are basic and unforgiving but men were executed for voicing concern about their safety and this happened in modern times whether it was a reflection of the soviet army or of his particular penal control unit i do not know he said everywhere soviet soldiers were hungry under equipped poorly led and morale was terrible then again his experience is limited to kazak region 1 war game and penal duty i am kind of mind blown to be honest i had to let it out of me
apparently life as a soviet army soldier circa 1980s was hell

or are the two even related linguistically i have been on a pre wwi history kick lately and the region of the caucasus and the slavic world in general at and before that time are greatly interesting and as a white relatively well educated citizen of the united states with an admittedly limited world view fairly alien to me i am also concurrently on an age of exploration kick as well and both periods have pretty heavy undertones of meddling in the regions surrounding the black sea this was just sort of a diversion and nagging question at the back of my mind edit my intention with this question was not to open a discussion or debate over race as even the concept of race is debatable my curiosity ends at the etymology of the word caucasian as it relates to geography and history alone thankfully my question has been answered and my curiosity quenched by many wonderful and properly cited sources thank you to everyone who contributed meaningfully
q at what point did the word caucasian stop referring to the people of the caucasus and start referring to white people in general

so i found a lot of boxes one such box of letters in my mother s loft attic hundreds some from ww1 the rest from ww2 they are completely original in envelopes with post marks etc and in pretty good condition i thought this one was interesting as the soldier writing mentions german snipers and ruined french towns and some fairly mundane things too dated 22 aug 1915 sent to my great grandparents by this young man in the army in the trenches fighting the germans in the north east of france in loos near lille near the border with belgium the letter is from private edward currie 12th battalion highland light infantry british expeditionary force he was killed on 25 sept 1915 34 days after writing this and is buried in loos memorial pas de calais france it is quite hard to read from the images here is a transcription pte edw currie 19054 d coy 12th batt h l i b e f 22nd aug 1915 dear mam i now take time to write to you as i know you are anxious to hear from me i had made up my mind not to write to you again after our little difference of opinion but it was against my grain as i know you were always interested in me and i know it would be too bad not to let you know how i am getting along whilst in the trenches i am in the trenches at present having a lively time of it and quite realise the murderous work the germans are doing censorship prevents me telling the names of places i have been in but they are a sight beautiful garden citys with no sign of life whatsoever with these many mansions furnished complete with the roof blown off or the gables of the wall shattered with these many shells as one goes further along only skeleton of houses are to be seen our dugouts in the trenches are furnished with mirrors chairs etc making things making things look cosy and comfortable those being had from the ruined houses close at hand by day our sentries watch over the parapet just across to the enemy s trenches a few hundred yards away if there heads were to be seen they are sure to be shot at and they are pretty good shots too they possess a set of men called snipers who seem to be everywhere that one cannot be too sure where he goes in case he is within range of one of these fellows this is all i can say about trench life in the meantime it is giving you an idea what is the case in some of the many places in france i saw mr name s brother in one of the villages i have been in he was taking over our billets for his battallion the 10th gordons as we were leaving for the trenches i myself am having a good time of it and have nothing to complain off although we are not getting it all our own way i hope to be remembered to all the boys and to those who are anxious to know how i am keeping i will close in the meantime hoping you all spent an enjoyable holiday camp thoughts of it reminding me of monkton and the good times i have spent there from yours truly eddy currie edit wow thank you all for the responses and pms i have replied to you all individually and am now going through the comments and will reply to any directed to me wow not sure i can keep going there is a lot note 1 monkton refers to a place near glasgow in scotland i shall find out for sure but some of you in the comments have identified the location my family is scottish pte edward currie was scottish he died 25th sept 1915 a month after this letter i have located his memorial note 2 i am so sorry the letters are not for sale these are too historically valuable and money is not deserving of their worth if you get me however i will scan more of them for those who asked i will endeavour to track down their descendants and give them the letters the rightful owners i think failing that war museums will gladly accept them i am sure i will post pte edward eddy currie s other 4 letters for you today note 3 to clarify these letters are currently in my possession rightfully and honestly these young men were hosted at a boarding house oakshaw ran by my grandfather s parents after signing up prescription and before they were posted to the south of england prior to deployment in france they wrote very kindly back to my great grandmother mam to keep her updated of how they were i assume they would also have written to their parents but of course i do not have those letters note 4 thank you humbly for the pms from current and ex military i hope my replies were worthy enough note 5 billets temporary housing for soldiers the missing words i hope to be remembered to all the boys note 6 the disagreement some of you ask about does not sound romantic more like he mis behaved before he left stole something argued about politics the war not sure i will try and find out

note my grandfather passed away last fall and we are still going through his belongings he saved many correspondence some are hard to read because the letters are handwritten and nearly 80 years old however i just came across this letter i have seen other letters from this same guy and i know he grew up in the same neighborhood with my grandfather although my grandfather and this guy went to different schools their entire lives they kept in touch while the friend was serving in ww2 i had not gotten a chance to read any letters until tonight and this was the first one i read and it is intense you ll get this when you read but it seems that my attorney grandfather had written to his friend complaining about how busy and hard his job was well as you might imagine his friend while serving in the philippines in ww2 was pretty pissed about that and he did not hold back ps thanks to commenters who are better versed in ww2 and better at reading the handwriting than i am i am making corrections and edits as they come in here s the link to the original and here s the full transcription philippine islands july 25 1945 stan from out of the philippines where it my dear lawyer is still spelled with 1 l i send a reply to one of the foulest notes that it has ever been my misfortune to receive quote as for myself i have been very busy the last week or two although the course of work in this hard boiled slave driving under paid profession etc etc well little boy you may be a shining light in the tiny legal world you exist in but the insinuation you made in your letter showed me that you do not know what life today is all about you are living in a sphere that is bound up with things cut and dried things which are dealt with as cases and not realities and yet you have the impudent gall to sit back and complain about your own way of life you who have always had a good home fine parents and sufficient funds you attended a private school a college and a law school in spite of the times you got a job in an old firm and you have your place in life in other words you have had everything handed to you on a silver platter and yet you still complain you also speak of being busy well that is a joke it seems to me that i have heard of some others who are busy today have you heard of the b 29 boys over japan or the carrier task force or the boys who took back the philippines or the 19 000 boys who had a busy time on okinawa or the guys on saipan guam new guinea or guadalcanal or course the aussies are not busy on borneo of course not no these guys and millions of others are merely sitting around finely furnished offices and telling others they have been very busy as for being hard boiled there is no such thing in the service all those with whom we associate treat us like their own children things are always calm and serene the cases one finds are never crude or tough the stinking corpses of american boys boys whom life never gave a chance are nice things to observe no life in this business is not hard boiled if it is not then neither is a sniper s bullet thru the forehead and then you mentioned slave driving the phrase used by you is sheer mockery the works of the coalies on the great airfields of china was sheer pleasure the anzio beachead was a picnic for the boys carving out that tiny foothold the boys who spanned the plane under point blank fire were having an enjoyable time the guys who lugged ashore on their backs the supplies that helped to take tarawa were just getting some exercise no this was not slave driving work it was mere amusement as one might take back home on a quiet sunday afternoon and then you said under paid that is just plain riot the boys who were killed at pearl harbor were under paid the men at kiska and attu were under paid the boys who hit the beach of normandy were underpaid the maquis of france were under paid no according to you these men were making a fortune some will come back but is the stinking 50 a month overpaying a dead american private in the lonely mountains of italy is the service pay of a pilot too much of course he may come back but there is a chance he may be just charred remains in a wrecked plane he does not earn his money he is overpaid yes the boys who invade japan will be overpaid it is too bad that the legal profession cannot pay off like the services fighting this war yes we are all wealthy men according to your idea of being underpaid stan i have always respected you for your knowledge and ability but you seem to be so wrapped up in that smug little world of yours that you do not know what is going on in terms of reality you see newsreels read papers scan magazines and that makes you a judge of your position whether you know it or not you are a very lucky guy you have your education your job and future planned and then on top of that you have the audacity to write hard boiled slave driving under paid profession if this letter does nothing else i hope that it makes you ashamed of yourself right down to the marrow of your bones you may say now who is brown that he can pass judgment on the great lawyer granted to your way of thinking he is not in a position to do so i think differently i am a guy who only had three years in college i never graduated or went on to a professional school i know very little in the formal sense of the word but you ungrateful wretch i still know more about life than you ever will unless you change i have seen life in its rawest and crudest and death too for that matter yes my sheltered intellect the intellect the sordid and foul things of life can teach lessons i have learned things and learned to appreciate things that only the college of life can teach i do not regret this in fact i am proud of it and i think i will be a better person for all of it if you are half a man you will make some reply to what i have written above i realize that it may not be a finely phrased but the truth is not always finely phrased your obedient slave sgt richard h brown army air forces somewhere in the philippines edit i am almost certain that i found sgt brown s obituary and i have identified a surviving daughter interestingly enough if it is the right obituary and the daughter is the person i am thinking of i actually went to school with sgt brown s grandson for a few years and our families know each other having met at school functions in the past i will be reaching out to sgt brown s daughter today to offer her these letters edit 2 left a voicemail on the only number i found on the daughter guess i can only wait and see edit 3 welp obligatory thanks for the gold i left another voicemail on another number i found waiting on a call back so unfortunately no real updates glad this meant so

these tapes are actual real life footage of the discovery of nazi concentration camps by british and american solders after the end of ww2 alfred hitchcock arranged them in the format that they were originally meant to be viewed disclaimer what you are about to watch is extremely disturbing and includes depictions of actual death starvation disease suffering and torture it is horrific watch at your own risk edit spelling update 1 thank you for up voting this and promoting this video i think it is very important that people see this remember what happened and honor those who died i have read every one of your comments and you are all good people continue to show kindness to others online and off thanks again update 2 video changed to 480p without subtitles thank you u  here is the original video i posted with dutch subs also on the pbs website update 3 some additional information about the film thanks to u khnagar memory of the camps is indeed hitchock s documentary about the camps but it was not hidden from the public for fourty years after the war interest in the footage waned there were plenty of similar documentaries around and the footage used for memory of the camps was available in various film archives and institutions not at all hidden away hitchcock was involved with the documentary but it was not his creation alone and it seems that his involvement had mostly to do with how the material was structured in 1980 someone discovered the old reels though the sixth reel was missing and it was shown at the berlin film festival in 1984 and broadcast on american pbs in 1985 the youtube uploader seems to have ripped this from a 1993 vcd i remember reading earlier this year that the imperial war museum is restoring the whole original movie with the missing sixth reel and it will be shown on the bbc in 2015 for the 70th anniversary for the liberation of europe update 4 wow thanks for the gold

edit if you would like to help with the search please go to r thehuntfor852 hey everyone i was reading about the history of somalia during world war 2 i knew a bit about the war so i was just refreshing my memory however i come across mention of a naval battle off the coast of somalia apparently bombers forced u 852 to beach on the coastline during a naval battle the text is below as u 852 broke the surface her gun crews swarmed out and manned the anti aircraft guns even as the crewman were reaching their battle stations the wellingtons were starting their second strafing run the planes roared overhead and smothered the boat with fire oberleutnant georg colditz and matrosenobergefreiter josef hofer both died on the bridge u 852 was down by the stern unable to dive and under attack by this time it was clear to eck that his boat was finished while he could not save his boat he was determined to save his crew and his only hope of accomplishing this was to beach u 852 on the somaliland coast before the british sank her although doomed the u boat managed to hold off the british throughout much of the day her gunners beating off each aerial attack several of the crewmen were killed or wounded during the repeated strafing runs but causalities were surprisingly light given the circumstances that afternoon while still under attack eck managed to save the bulk of his crew by beaching his battered boat off the somaliland coast at ras hafun source theodore p savas silent hunters german u boat commanders of world war ii intrigued i dug a bit deeper but could not find much information on what happened to the wreck what i did find was that the captain was unable to scuttle the ship so the british were able to loot the boat since i am in somalia i decided to google the town ras hafun in somali xaafuun i then zoomed in and went along the coast i was shocked to find what resembles a wreckage i am not 100 sure but the rock formations resemble those in the few photos that remain of the wreckage here is what i found wikipedia for photos of the wrecked boat from ww2 and notice the rock formations google map of the this could obviously be the wreckage of any ship or it could be nothing at all i was hoping for you guys to look at this and to get your opinions on the following 1 does this resemble the wreckage of a uboat 2 is the location of the wreck sufficient with the historical material 3 do you notice similar wrecks in the area if there is enough interest i can make a trip to the region it will take atleast 2 days and some planning to check out the site and confirm please let me know what you think edit map showing location of u 852 edit2 some sources say it was beached near bandarbeyla far away from ras hafun i search this coast and was unable to find much can some people check out the coast here edit3 i found an raf report that says the wreckage was just south of ras hafun this would coorespond with the wreckage found on google maps in addition i found a classified australian military report on the incident it is quite detailed just ctrl f 852 edit 4 is anyone in the uk there are numerous photos oral and written accounts of the battle and search for u 852 however they take quite a while to respond to me and charge a large fee to get the documents digitally can someone go to the imperial war museum in london in order to get copies of those documents edit 5 can someone look at 9 576783 50 803232 and tell me if it resembles a submarine i see two distinct shapes it is 100km from the original site though so i am wondering if i should venture out edit 6 important if you would like to help with the search please go to r thehuntfor852 edit 7 a user found a map showing the current wreck site it is 100km south from where we thought the wreck we were looking at may actually be from 1870 please refer to this link for the update

i was on a road trip and stopped at the booker t washington national monument in virginia while reading one of the information posts one sentence resonated with me in such a way that i walked away with a new understanding of what slavery in the united states was like addressing the slave trade it read along the lines of while physical punishment was certainly a factor that kept slaves working to produce high quality crops an even larger factor was the possibility of family members being sold away if crops did not yield enough money for the plantation owners slaves worked to keep their families together that really just portrays the horror of slavery in a way that no textbook has ever been able to for me honored to see all of the discussion i hope to read through it all

we know about some germans that during wwii helped people that were endarged by the nazis actions e g oskar schindler and others from righteous among the list i wonder if there were any japanese who opposed their country s attrocities in asia and somehow helped oppresed people i found out about chiune but he operated in europe i am more interested in similar situations on the territories conquered by japan during wwii do you know any edit it seems that my choice of the title for this thread was slightly unfortunate i am not implying that every japanese was evil during wwii only searching for known examples of decent behavior in the face of atrocities for example some officer lodging a protest to his superiors about some massacre not sure if this was even possible in japanese imperial military culture i do not know a lot about it

i went through all 12 years of gov t schooling in the us and heard about it is greatness and achievements for all 12 of them including but not limited to the civil war freeing the slaves the victory of wwii defeating hitler it was not until moving to canada and being exposed to non us gov t regulated learning material that i learned about monumental failures and embarrassments those include the failed invasion of canada in 1812 the japanese internment camps in wwii freeing only the southern slaves to cripple the rebel s economy during the civil war not to mention the constitution allowed states to secede and the war killed upwards of 600 000 americans by americans the incineration of hundreds thousands of non combatant citizens in hiroshima and nagasaki and other things that were not taught or spun in a favorable light to the us image i realize that all of this information could have been found on the internet or other media but alternative learning was not something that was ever suggested or encouraged in my gov t education not sure what my point is here but anyone else have similar experiences about learning something else about major historical events from a non biased perspective update ok so i realize that i am at fault for not doing independent research on the issues that i have mentioned when i was in school i did not really find history as fascinating as i do now that i am not forced to learn about it and can look into things that interest me at my own pace it is more than likely these things were addressed but in a manner that didnt grab my attention enough to make an impact and retain the information also it was naive of me to think that leaning about canadian history in canada would not also be biased thanks everyone for your comments

i was really disheartened to see how many of you grabbed on to the patriot revisionist line that use of atomic weapons on japan was necessary in the moment and somehow saved lives this is not true this is what we tell ourselves to excuse the fact that we as a nation are responsible for the 420 000 names on japan s hiroshima peace memorial the japs as president truman called them had already asked for peace 420 000 is a lot of people to get a sense of this number try to think of the population of your hometown your university your company etc and multiply it by the appropriate factor better yet imagine everything you have ever felt love sadness excitement hunger warmth hope rejection and so on then multiply it by 420 000 i m paraphrasing annie dillard here but i cannot find the exact quote i was under the impression that we proceeded with the bombing largely to scare russia out of any notion of expanding their empire after world war ii however i had like to hear the other interpretations as for evidence president truman had written in his journals that the japanese had tried to surrender previously i have posted quotes from that journal in duplicate below if you have any further information please feel free to post it however please note the source of citation and try to find items from reputable outlets if not primary sources as opposed to shit like wikipedia and warheroez net a critical message of july 12 1945 just before potsdam showed that the japanese emperor himself had decided to intervene to attempt to end the war in his private journal truman bluntly characterized this message as the telegram from the jap emperor asking for peace inspected guard and went in for lunch p m and i ate alone discussed manhattan it is a success decided to tell stalin about it stalin had told p m of telegram from jap emperor asking for peace stalin also read his answer to me it was satisfactory believe japs will fold up before russia comes in i am sure they will when manhattan appears over their homeland i shall inform stalin about it at an opportune time if anyone has anything that contradicts this please let us know

ever since i took a politics of war class two year ago in college i have wondered whether it was truly necessary to drop fat man and little boy on japan to end the war i understand the reasoning was that the alternative to this was a full scale land invasion which would have been much more costly to both sides my main question against their usage in august of 1945 was japan in a position to conduct a legitimate offensive against u s positions if not then my position is that if japan was incapable of attacking and was economically hampered by the allies blockade could not it have been possible to just sit back and wait for their inevitable surrender meaning that the dropping of these bombs was just a display of power against the soviet union or was it more likely that there would have been more deaths by starvation before japan surrendered what do you guys think edit i am looking for opinions from a pure military aspect

why has every major western power had russia as its enemy
i recently finished making a documentary on the mau mau crisis in kenya shamlessselfpromotion link here while making that documentary it dawned on me that the british not only did a ton of shitty things but they did a combination of shitty things which on their own have become infamous in other situations the reservation of american indians the british did that in almost all of their colonies in kenya they set up african reserves forced the natives off thier land and basically trapped the natives into working for them by having them pay a rent and taxes which were higher than their maximum salaries fucking over veterans the british did that too they drafted many africans into the kar during wwii promising better living conditions for them when they returned when they came back surprise the british gave them nothing when one african ethnic group the kikuyu formed a violent revolutionary organization who committed war crimes of their own including hacking a 6 year old to death and burning down entire villages the british did not pay any attention to the mau mau s claims that their land was stolen and instead thought that the mau mau were all crazy from some mental illness spread by their oathes so their solution lock up an entire ethnic group of people in concentration camps when america interned large amounts of people we payed attention to it and eventually paid reparations when the germans took millions of jews into concentration camps and slaughtered them wholesale it has been rightly recognized as one of the worst atrocities ever committed but when the british lock up over a million people depending on whose numbers you use i use caroline elkins estimates because they had the most evidence behind them at least from what i saw in concentration camps and use some of the most gruesome forms of torture ever put to use such as drilling into detainees eardrums filling their anuses with sand and water and pushing it into their intestines with sticks forcing pins into detainees fingernails and anuses clamping down on testicles with metal rods etc and almost nobody has even heard of this happening history is fickle but i had like to believe that we pay attention to things like the holocaust because not only should we learn from them but not to do so is an injustice in and of itself i feel the same way about the mau mau crisis and other atrocities committed by the british but even moreso as the world turned its back to these people and it still has barely even recognized them
why do you think many atrocities committed by the british in their colonies have gone completely ignored

plateus small mountains and volcanoes you can go from desert to beautiful forestry in a matter of minutes you head north to the colorado river where the rivers roll through seas of trees and hills you can enjoy one of the worlds worst beaches in galveston not too pretty but the history is rich in galveston and this port city serves as one of the biggest in the nation western cities hold farmers ranchers good old fashioned texas folk white black hispanic demographically we have a pretty good spread galveston houston austin and dallas are rich with business and culture these cities have their ups and downs the rich and poor but nevertheless are some of the biggest and most productive cities in the entire world san antonio bears the scars of our revolution and remains prodominately mexican both culutrally and demographically cities like shiner are german towns with the population mainly speaking german and brew shiner beer towns like west texas are czech and sell the best damn sausage i have ever eaten dallas and houston are practically twins austin seems to be the yankee safe haven in the south but i assure you that compared to our other major cities austin is relatively small if you drive twenty minutes north get off of 1 35 and go east or west you are out in hill country that is rich with agriculture houston is the same way you drive out 290 towards austin you will find yourself in college station texas really has a bad rap for racism although in every society bad apples exist i have lived here my entire life am a white middle class male and every instance of racism i have ever ran into was immediately combated you just do not see much confederate flag waving rednecks here and if you do no one likes them college station was the cotton region for texas this is probably where most people get their racist ideas from but those times are long gone a m is a huge culturally diverse college it holds to its southeren traditions but you do not see public lynchings if you travel to mississippi or arkansas you are more likely to see a segregated society this is not due to white oppression it is due to the natural course of history that naturally evolved into a segregated society both the white and black populations in the south are extremely poor the point i am trying to get across is that texans are a strange type of people all of us are little bit mexican black white farmer and city folk texas is so diverse and flexible that it hurts me to hear some of you guys call us stupid rednecks with a bad attitude towards america you are failing to recognize the beauty of our state and disrepecting its occupants while doing so now on the ideas of secession you have to understand the way texans are taught about their history and culture it is the same way all americans are taught about the revolution it is taught in way to inspire a feeling of patriotism and pride when you hear about the founding fathers standing up to the british and establishing their own country against all odds and winning a victory that resulted in the institution of democracy texans kind of have their own story we are taught that a bunch of extremely poor rowdy uneducated farmers stood up against the tyrannical mexican government and took a chunk of land they could call their own we are taught that blood was shed for our state and in any case this is always inspiring men died for the republic of texas god damnit this is not the point though the point is that texans grew up hearing all about this revolution i gurantee all of you have seen john wayne s the alamo or how travis with his sword drew a line in the sand and told everyone they were certainly all going to die and that anyone can leave at any moment but if you wish to fight to cross the line and stand with him everyone with exception to one the biggest coward in texas history crossed the line and everyone died at school we stand up and recite the texas pledge with our right hands raised to the flag we are extremely patriotic to the ideals of america but we love our state this is just something texans understand without needing to be said texas is a predominatly neoconservative political environment rick perry was elected because of his appeal to neoconservatives and the agricultural population these inhabitants believe very strongly about limited government right to gun possession and each have a sense of rebellion in each of them you can judge them for who they are or their ideology most of them are good people and grew up in an environment that breeds this ideology in recent years the state has become more purple with the major cities turning more liberal the newcoming population from northern more liberal states combat with the native population this pool of extreme nationalism breeds a ripe environment for an excitement when anyone mentions the word secession as you can imagine the civil war still plays a huge part in our everyday lives down south the recovery never truly came until the civil rights movement when racism was broadly addressed texas kept a pretty good standing after the civil war because its economy found refuge in oil i mention this because i am getting to my most important point the division of the north and south is still strong this is not recent the civil war did nothing to fix the division i put the blame on the assassination of lincoln this extreme state of poverty that persisted in the south after the years of rebuilding created a ripe situation of angst and hatred for the north after lincoln s death jackson did exactly what lincoln never wanted a punishment for the south they striped everything they owned and left them with nothing the effects of this poverty are still present this punishment led to further division that still exist today it is very important to not feed such prejudices and combat the natural tendency to point fingers and blame others texans are people just like the rest of the south although i know the south is just as guilty as pointing fingers i do not think two wrong make a right if you have never been to south come on down we have good food great music and love to drink beer and have a great time white black mexican muslim you re more than welcome we love your company and especially your business haha edit if you have never read a book by h w brands called lone star nation i would highly suggest it if you are interested in texas history it is unromanticized and well written he is a professor at u t and has many other great books as well and another edit i have removed all political views from this post because the comments are becoming a political discussion and i do not want that
for those of you wondering a little about texas and why they want to secede

i do not get it there are not that many mongols to begin with i understand they were fearsome warriors and had mastery of horses and what not but how in the world were they able to capture so much land how did they possibly have the man power to do so how did they go from a backwater nomadic kingdom to the rulers of most of the known world tactically also i do not understand how they won pitched battles because they were masters at horse archery and other nomadic styles of warfare when they faced off against more developed nations like the islamic kingdoms china and eastern europe how did they defeat them in warfare i understand how they conquered the steppe but not china the middle east and eastern europe
how did the mongols conquer so much considering they were a backwards nomadic culture
i am not sure what is going on to me but i do not like it it all started when i first started dropping acid i would feel uneasy like someone we watching me even when i was not on it i would feel as if people were staring at me but have to remind myself to be rational my life just became more stressful after that i entered what would be a very verbally and emotionally abusive relationship with a man 10 years older than me i would frequently have invasive thoughts about him being killed on the street so i became very anxious and worried for his safety after the abuse started my self esteem lowered and i attempted suicide once with an overdose of pills obviously i did not die because i am hear today to write this post at the peak of the abuse i decided to obtain an ord r of protection against the abusive asshole when i had court i was sitting in the court room in total silence and i just hear my ex say this is all your fault i heard it totally clearly i turn around and my ex is sitting far across the room staring at me but not within earshot i later asked him and he promises to me he did not say anything in fact i know he did not because he was legally barred from communicating with me and the security guard in the courtroom would have told him to stop if he started speaking to me none the less in a crowded silent court room anyways since that incident i have been having increasingly more invasive thoughts sometimes it will feel like my head is screaming i will close my eyes and see a black figure staring at me from a window and then run away i will feel like i am losing control and feel like i might flip out at my second and do something i had regret i am not actually sure what is going on but i kind it to be unpleasant i have family history of mental illness on both sides depression anxiety and addiction on my fathers side and schizophrenia depression anxiety and addiction on my father has anyone experienced anything like this before could these be the beginnings of schizophrenia

hello i apologize in advance if this is silly i just want to have different opinions on what is going on inside my head or maybe find some guidance keep in mind that i am not very talkative with my family thus i cannot really ask them about this i do not remember much of my childhood however i remember a very strange scene i was probably 4 or 5 and i was crying in the bathroom and my underwear was full of blood i also remember my mother being very angry and she was washing off the blood off my underwear in the bathroom sink i am now a 23 year old woman and i can remember this exact scene as if it happened yesterday yet i have no memory of what happened before or after that as you can see it still haunts me since i have no idea about the context i was wondering did my brain make this up i have to add something though my parents described me as a kid as a very joyful one who would even go with my parents friends easily i used to be full of life apparently and i would dance anywhere and clap my hands most of the time to show my happiness something must have changed dramatically because most of my memories after that are mostly being extremely afraid of everyone and crying a lot for example i would cry if my parents dropped me at catechism or if they were just a bit late to pick me up from school i even remember a friend of mine back in the day who would make fun of me because of how much i kept crying over nothing oh and i probably should add that i still have to this day this great habit of crying over nothing even though it is not the same reason anymore it is more because i am extremely sensitive i guess tl dr i remember a strange scene very vividly it happened when i was a child but i have no memory of its context did my brain make it up somehow to mess me up a bit more i had like to believe my brain made it up but i am not sure
strange vivid memories not sure if they are real
so being a working middle class mother of 2 boys i have prided myself of staying out of the system i became a mother at the age of 16 and since i did not have a legal guardian for myself i was not able to receive any type of assistance other than medical assistance by the age of 20 i was working a great job and dropped medical assistance fast forward 14 years and i am now an accounts receivable supervisor with a fortune 500 company i do my part pay for insurance keep money in a fsa account to offset expenses etc i also now have a 10 year old son i am currently separated from his dad who pays just enough child support to stay out of court but will not do anything to really help my 10 year old has been diagnosed with a sensory processing disorder it basically means he has heightened senses and so textures loud noises and such make him upset he is thought to also have odd and maybe some anxiety and depression the problem is that i cannot afford to take him to a doctor long enough to get an actual diagnosis due to the cost 35 co pay 20 co insurance his father will not sign off to allow a psychologist to actually see him as he feels that there is not anything wrong here s the problem my child is struggling in school refuses to do school work was held back in kindergarten due to not being mature enough for 1st grade and now he is a child that screams at everyone that looks at him or attempts to talk to him he has even threatened to hurt himself just this week not knowing what else to do i finally took him to the only insurance approved facility to handle children in my area they wanted him admitted immediately into either an in patient care or admitted into a partial hospitalization i agreed to the partial hospitalization as my son was able to articulate everything that happened and understand the scope of the situation i arrive this morning ready for his first 6 hour treatment only to find out that my deductible is not met because we have only paid the out of network deductible for his counseling this year i have a 20 coinsurance and the facility does not bill patients in order for my child to get the right help i have to pay 315 for the first day 300 for the second day and then 63 per day after that this is a minimum 2 weeks of treatment i do not have that type of money i have been on my own so long and started out in life by being in debt the sad reality is that if i would have not attempted to better my life and just would have lived the stereotype of a teenage mom my son would be getting the right type of help instead i am missing work praying i do not get fired and keeping knives hidden in my home tldr 10 year old has dark thoughts but due to a deductible and coinsurance that is unaffordable i have a child that is missing out on proper treatment

i have been doing almost the same job for the past 5 years first at one agency then i moved to a new agency about 5 months ago i have been incredibly stressed this year due to work load and pressure from my last agency i was having to stay in the office until after 8pm on many nights due to lack of staff i was generally the only one in my department it got to the point where i started drinking heavily and i then got big stomach problems mid way through the year by the time i was about to move i had really bad stomach problems and i had severe anxiety i was given 3 days off work in my first week and was prescribed anti depressants diazepam by my gp i hate the idea of anti depressants and refused to take them i was also referred to a gastroenterologist who performed an endoscopy and found my stomach was inflamed in summary i have been feeling incredibly stressed burnt out and unwell this year on top of this i have had a general fatigue i have noticed this is also causing problems at work as i am missing things making mistakes and my manager has begun noticing these and bringing them up i have now spent a while thinking about what to do and i have decided i want to hand in my notice take a month or two out to spend time with my family who i only get to see once a year as they live in another country and then go freelance afterward my question is though is there a good bad time to hand it in i want to hand it in this week if possible as i have a 3 month notice and would much rather be out by end of february my only concern is that i do not want to be seen as handing in my notice in the midst of me making mistakes in my head it will look like i am running away and i am worried it will make my line manager thing badly about me should i not worry about this and do it now or wait until the new year which will mean i have to wait until april to get time off tl dr i have been very stressed and burnt out this year along with mental and physical health problems i want to hand in my notice to take a few months off then go freelance yet do not want to make it look like i am running away after making a few mistakes should i just do it now or wait
should i hand in notice and not worry
so i was wondering if theres a possibility that i have depression for as long as i can remember i have always struggled with being happy or enjoying things my brain has always had this mental barrier that wont let me go any further then this mid point of numbness i have always thought maybe theres something wrong with me and its not depression maybe i am not trying to be happy or forcing myself to smile enough but i just literally mentally cant or do not know how to and even when i do smile it does not feel real even when good things happen to me my brain will do this thing where it will convince me it is not real even though i know it is but it does not care and i wont be able to feel good about it no matter how hard i mentally try i even get mental break downs of forcefullness to force my brain to be happy but it does not go anywhere i just give my self an actual headache or a feeling of tension in my brain area but when its negative things my brain believes it its like theres a barrier inside my head that i cant get past there was even a point where i wanted to be happy about something so bad that i started to literally bang my head with my fist to get my brain to work properly but the barrier is still there its as if my brain does not know what i am asking of it or as if it does not exist to my brain and the barrier is as far as i can go the numbness it feels like a part of my brain is missing or is not functioning its like trying to ask a computer to run a software that is not downloaded feels like i can actually feel the barrier there and it wont move no matter what this is whats leading me to believe i some sort of mental disorder and with the numbness being my highest mental point i thought being numb is being happy but the numbness does not feel good it just feels like a break from the lower mental points like just a midline that cant get any higher no matter what is this possibly depression i am thinking about visiting a walk in clinic in a couple days time after keeping this to my self for practically all my life p s i posted this on r askdocs for feedback but did not get a lot of responses was hoping i can get more minds onto this also i forgot to mention that i am suicidal but have not told anyone i have attempted suicide multiple times but always stopped when things got close its mostly because i start to get scared even when i know what i want which causes me to get very frustrated thanks for the help in advance
could this be depression
i ran out a few weeks ago and was wondering how quick they are i am feeling a tat bit low edit1 i am away from home and i cant see my gp about the meds or how i am feeling i am just wanting to know how fast they are at getting my meds to me
anyone whos from the uk use medcare to get sertraline
hi guys i am on this meds combo my doctor who is very old said i should not drink alcohol during the course of medication my friend s doctor said it is fine as long as it is not often not daily not every other day i know some would say follow your doctor but these conflicting advises bother me i am asking just as a form of survey i am not asking for opinion just your personal experience so here are the two questions applicable only to people drinking this combo 1 did your doctor tell you never to drink while on these meds 2 did you follow it if no did you have terrible side effects thank you guys if anybody s asking i am not an alcoholic i rarely drink i am just asking because i am going back to my hometown this december and be meeting with my friends who will almost surely ask me to drink with them yes i can say no but it is a culture thing so if i find out here that i cannot drink at all then i will not be meeting up with them
medication question sertraline and resperidone combo
ok so i am not sure if this is anything but for the last year or so especially the last few months i have just been getting more and more paranoid about things mainly people hearing me i cannot have the windows open in the house because i feel like the neighbours are listening to everything i do at night i have become really frightened literally lying in bed ears pricked incase anyone is in the house having to get up to make sure the doors are locked multiple times in the night my friends talking about me behind my back even though i know or at least i hope lol that they would not be it is probably nothing but it is just been getting worse and my dad has some mental health issues so i thought i should see if this could be caused by anything cause it is starting to effect my life also sorry for bad grammar and spelling if there is any on my phone and cbf proof reading edit i forgot to mention that going out in public has become a big problem in my life too i feel like everyone is just watching everything i do and that i just stand out so much forgot to mention it because i do not really leave the house anymore except to go get food which is a stressful time so it did not even really cross my mind haha

i am 27 and have finally decided to confront serious issues i have been ignoring for about 15 years when i was in middle school i joined a cult with my mom i moved away from my friends and the rest of my immediate family to a rural area with her and her abusive boyfriend who was high up in the cult i endured deep depressing years of solitude there where i developed a drinking problem at about 12 shortly upon moving back to the city i grew up in when i was 14 i started making some bad decisions and ended up being sexually assaulted by someone much older than me i then dropped out of school and my drinking habit worsened i started taking a large amount of drugs all my serious personal relationships went downhill and i spent my time on short personal and romantic relationships where i would not have to let anyone get to know me i eventually turned a lot of this around and went to college developed a meaningful career and got into a longterm relationship i tried to pretend none of the traumatic experiences were still impacting me last week i confronted my mother for the first time about the cult i told her about the sexual assault which i had never told anyone i realized how much of my life was still constantly shaped by those experiences for the first time in my life i am willing to admit the trauma from those experiences has fucked me up and i need to actually get help i recently moved to a new city and just got out of a five year relationship i want to find a therapist who can help me with those deep issues but also someone who could help me with the issues i am dealing with in my immediate life i have no idea where to start if someone could give me some advice on how to get started finding someone i can trust and who can help me i would appreciate it

where to start ever since i was a child i was always very lonely having come from another country i have no brothers sisters or family i could count on never had a best friend that i could spend my free time with and would be there for me when i most needed it i have had several friends over the years but something always occurs that make them become distance such as never having classes with them or just general drama where i had very little control since middle school one friend did remain and i hang out with him to this day during school he is extremely introverted and even through my attempts at reaching out to him to go places he refuses i have attempted telling him what pains me but he himself is akward about emotions and just makes a joke as if it will help me shrug it off i appreciate his attempt but i neeed seriouse advice now that i have stated just how lonely these past 18 years have been let me begin with whats hurting me first of all my parents have refused to allow me to go to any type of mental therapist something along the lines that they cannot afford it i once attempted to ask and he directed me to a family member whom of course i did not feel comfortable speaking to due to the relations my mother and father get extremely stressed when i mention that i am in any sort of pain last time i was in seriouse mental pain my mother fell ill simply from stress i am terrified to mention that i want to go to a therapist this year i began in my first real relationship and at first it was great because we were able to hang out often and she was very loving and caring however a little oblivious jerrica false name has practiced a sport all her life and after a season i found her rarely being able to spend time with her instead of 3 hours every day i see her every morning for 5 minutes then mabye another 20 during lunch after highschool it is very likely i will study out of state and simply the idea of long distance horrible cripples my heart i have felt so alone all my life and now after experiencing a slight glimmer of hope it is being taken away again she is hopeful for the long distance which only hurts me more the more i think how greedy i am being how i might hurt her how i keep hurting myself it just keeps piling on subconciouslly i look forward to college as an escape from this cycle but it is months away i am a senior and i am already in so much pain i tend to overthink things which itself might be a product of my loneliness and the fact that 90 of my afterschool life has been around the 4 walls of my room with my games and anime i have made great aquaintances i hope to keep good relations with untill i graduate but they are close friends with my girlfriend and i only fear i will lose this little peace at school and have it replaced with akwardness and only more loneliness all these thoughts compound in my head i try my best to not read into them and just be patient to see what occurs but i already feel so mentally strained i fear i have begun to fall out of love with her her pictures no longer stimulate any real response to me besides guilt the few moments i am with her i do tend to enjoy but now she has been taking less care of her looks and it only adds to my guilt of the possibility that i might not love her these doubts they are eating me from the inside i do not know what to do i feel i am being greedy but i still deserve peace i would like to think i do not have anyone to turn to please any advice should i bear the pain a little longer i have no shoulder to cry on no idea what to do someone please help i have not considered suicide but this itself feels like slow mental suicide i feel very fragile i am fairly new to reddit but i wanted this to be heard

hello everyone i have been on the same core medications lithium carbonate lamotrigine risperidone for almost a year now and have had great success with them i have switched over to the mail order pharmacy that my new insurance covers without thinking that they may dispense different formulations of my medications from different manufacturers than i am used to i received my shipment today and this is indeed the case all three have changed this may not seem like a big deal to most because in all formulations of a medication the active ingredient is the same but the inactive ingredients are not often the inactive ingredients including the delivery system of the active ingredient are very different this worries me because i had a very hard time adjusting to generic depakote when i was originally on name brand depakote having to go through formulation switches on all three of my major meds at the same time worries me does anyone have any thoughts or advice
rx formulations
i heard a male voice calling my name in a crowded hallway last week and posted about it on here since then i have heard the same voice calling my name again and saying i m in here from the heating vent in my apartment it was turned on in both cases it sounds external that is it is not a voice that i hear inside my head it sounds like a real person that is speaking to me and in fact sounds like someone i know which throws me off because i know logically that there cannot be a person in my heating vent i got in touch with my psychologist on campus after the first time hearing the voice and he told me to look for a psychiatrist through my student insurance the problem is most of the psychiatrists that i have tried to get in touch with are either not accepting new patients or they have a waiting period of 2 3 weeks i am worried about how this will progress in that period of time since i am already feeling a lot of anxiety because of both an increase in stress from finals and this new distressing phenomenon i am at a loss about what to do and having a hard time keeping things together any ideas about how i can intervene in this sooner rather than later

like when i sit still and think or watching tv or reading a book my hands will start picking pulling snapping and tearing anything around usually with a knife or some sort of pointed object a good example was my old bed frame it looked like it went through a tornado if blades from all the cuts scratches and chunks ripped out of the wood my personal body is a similar story but i am not sure if this quirk is related or not anyone know whats up with that or how i might be ables to replace and or stop it because i am worried about being at someone elses house and instinctively ruining their stuff thanks alot for feedback

it was 8am and i was on the bus to college i got a text from my therapist asking if i was ok to meet her today i replied with yes and thanked her for wishing me a happy birthday her text ended with an xx so i ended mine with xx too which she replied with a final x i got to the counselling offices early the room was felt small and claustrophobic all the seats were taken but one at the very end panicked and anxious i sit down on the furthest seat and look towards the wall for a couple of minutes until my therapist arrives to greet me and invite me into her office she stands tall the same height as me with black hair and hazel eyes she always dresses in colourful clothes and wears her hair down she has white sun kissed skin from her previous holiday to the mediterranean and always wears a smile on her face you can feel her energy happiness and warmth from her presence her confidence and sureness in life makes you feel safe in her company hi how was your birthday she asks in a warm caring tone it was ok i replied with my eyes glued to the floor i refused to look up it was like any other day my social anxiety ruled my life and she knew it too the conversation carried on for about 10 minutes until she brought up the courage to bring into the conversation how anxious i seemed i noticed you are being very distant from me right now is everything ok or are you anxious because it was busy outside it was busy outside i replied very anxious and stressed the conversation furthered until she began to ask mention how i barely ever look her in the eye uncomfortable and feeling vulnerable i keep my eyes on the floor as we discuss how when i feel vulnerable i look at the floor she tells me that the eyes are the doorways to the soul and that by not looking her in the eyes i am hiding my soul from her i felt very unsure however i agreed with her although i do not believe in souls i can understand what she means i feel there is something very warm about looking someone in the eyes something i miss deeply i explained how tense and vulnerable i feel when i look people in the eyes but she replies that it is ok if i dont want to look at her her left leg stretches out past the side of the coffee table i can see it in front of me as i am looking down at the floor it seems out of place and i am unsure why it is there i ignore it and look lower down at the floor i felt rude for not looking at her and how she had to mentioned it therefore i apologized it was just hard for me to look at anyone in the face she reminded me of the times i have looked at her in the past for just a glance however i told her that those times were always really short periods of time i struggled to hold it for very long without feeling uncontrollably uncomfortable she then tells me how she does not want me to miss out on life and that i have a future i should be enjoying it falling in love and being out with friends rather than being alone at home every day i agreed and she told me that she thinks i am a very sensitive person you re such a sensitive person she says in a informative tone i think being sensitive is a very good thing to be it means you actually care about other people and that is a good way to live i carry on looking at the floor and shrug i do not like it when a woman calls me sensitive i am a man after all it only makes me feel more pathetic but she repeats it nearly every session i think she sees it as a compliment however i feel very different on the matter as the conversation develops further it moves on to my relationship with my toxic friends i had previously been ostracized by people i have known for a year and it really upset me a couple of weeks back she told me just how honourable i am for not engaging in their childish games despite feeling angry she also told me she is never seen me angry but she knows i must get angry at home i tell her that is because i keep the anger to myself and there is no reason to take it out onto other people yet again she complements me telling me how grown up i am for not lashing out like the many others who have taken it out on me in the past the session ends 20 minutes after it is supposed to and i feel sadness not because she called me sensitive or because the session ended but because i have very deep feelings for my therapist i feel very attracted to her but have never said it she compliments me understands me and texts me on a regular basis i feel completely flustered by her presence i notice she sends me texts with x s in them and winky faces i also noticed the way she acts around me it feels so alien and strange i do not know if my emotions are viable or even if they are shared they are likely not shared however i have never had a person compliment me listen to me or seem interested in my life before my therapist seems so seductive without probably even trying i lay here in bed wishing i could tell her how i feel but i know she had reject me instantly therefore i never gained the courage to try i do not care what the world would think about it being unethical all i know is someone makes me happy and nobody else seems to care i feel incredibly lonely and only her company can make me feel happy again i live every day waiting for the next session each week the past few weeks have been very tough i cling to my therapist for a safety net of sorts i feel she sees me as maybe a son however i see her as a possible lover what a pathetic life i live
i am a pathetic loser and in love with my therapist
someone very close to me is really struggling to find happiness and i do not believe that i have the skills to make a long term difference i am just a regular guy with google but i had say that she struggles to some extent with low self esteem anxiety depression and codependency issues she has an alcoholic relative when i suggest that professional therapists could help her more than i can her objections include they ll just tell me to get over it the standard advice offered by her family i do not want my problems documented in somebody s computer or file cabinet i do not trust anyone else i cannot tell her to get lost when she needs my support but i really feel like we have been spinning our wheels trying to diy her mental health any advice that might help her sit down with with a professional would be very much appreciated

lawyers face much greater stigma than other professionals when revealing mental health or addiction issues
hey guys i am a 19 year old guy and i think i may have borderline personality disorder i am going to provide my reasoning and my plan of action and i had really like to get some input and advice basically what made me start to question whether or not my mental health was in a good place was that i would get pretty intense mood swings on a daily basis i would have feelings of intense sadness emptiness hopelessness but then someone would compliment me in some way and it felt like someone just stabbed me with morphine from insecure with thoughts of suicide to straight up cocky and grandiose thoughts also i am incredibly indecisive i will latch on to an idea because i am so sure at that moment in time that i have just found the answer to who i am but then i lose interest in a matter of hours days or weeks and then it is on to the next obsession life raft i am prone to reckless behavior reckless driving punching random things when i drink excessive amounts of alcohol extreme anxiety and dissociation am i on the right track here obviously i am no medical professional but borderline personality disorder seems to fit me like a glove when i look at common symptoms of mental disorders i am worried that this is just another one of my obsessions that i hope will fix my life but that is why i am going to try and see a professional once i am settled into my new base military like i said i would immensely appreciate some input

be aware that a lot of doctors do not have your best interest at heart
i have lost count of how many times my docs have set me up appointments after i am set to run out of medication because his her secretary cannot manage all their patients ffr if you give me 30 pills i am going to need to come back in 30 days or less it is not rocket science and when i tell the secretary that i am going to run out of meds before the appointment date she sets she just acts like it is nbd like there is no such thing as withdrawals i am on a daily 20mg xr dose of adderall and the withdrawals can be intense for the first two days you have interrupted sleep patterns like waking up every hour struggling to get back to sleep vivid dreams nightmares and general fatigue throughout the day then by the third day you get some serious depression and irritability you basically exist between the states of sad as hell and very pissed off what is even scarier is that while i notice the issues with sleep my family members are the ones who notice my behavior changes and point them out idk but that just really bothers me when other people are noticing changes in me that i do not even notice the same thing happened to me with the doc who prescribed me sertraline and those withdrawals were a lot worse but also less frequent i guess my question is this do doctors not understand how serious the withdrawal effects of the meds they prescribe are i have had two docs now that do not seem to have any idea that going 3 5 days without medication has a serious impact on one s life honestly i wish they had to take some of the stuff they prescribe and then go cold turkey off of it because then they had know just how crazy it can make you
rant do doctors not know wtf withdrawals are
i am 35 and never had any mental health problems before but yesterday i had booked a long haul flight to do some business a fair distance away eg 24 hours away it was a trip i was looking forward too i have never had any problems with fear of flying or anything i love travel on the day of travel i was getting really emotional at the thought of leaving my wife and kid but it started to get ridiculous i just kept thinking how unfair it was and what if something happened me etc etc ps i had her full support anyway ended up getting worse and worse until i cancelled the flight now sitting at home wishing i was there and wondering what the hell happened me and a tad embarrassed literally 5 hours of irrational behaviour as far as i am concerned and now i feel ok ps not particularly stressed at work only stress was a hope to get back in time for work in a weeks time was this a panic attack anxiety attack or what i got sweaty at times and cried a couple of times and had uncontrollable palpitations at times and felt warm all immediately relieved when i eventually cancelled the flight
panic attack or what
little background i am an 18 f and currently attending university i have never been diagnosed with depression but i always assumed that i had it i was bullied throughout freshman year of high school so i always point to that as my trigger for my flawed mentality i have always been a sensitive person in general little things constantly get me upset to the point where i will cry just recently i was trying to make a doctor s appointment but every physician happened to be booked for some reason when the technician told me this i quietly hung up the phone and started crying in some sort of defeat i find that i do this often with other random situations but i have no idea why i cry like this should i seek professional help to try to understand the root of my issues does anyone else find themselves crying over little things

american teens consume more illicit drugs than those in europe study
this was a problem for me a few years ago and i am worried it will become a problem again so i would appreciate thoughts advice if anyone has them so a few years ago i had a crush that lasted for several months my crush was the person i talked to the most besides family members coworkers etc but we were not very close they had a lot of friendships that were closer than ours whenever they did something that made me feel like they did not like me very much or they talked about personal issues online stuff like disordered eating self harm anxiety i would get really upset about it often to the point where i would self harm to deal with it i would feel like i had no right to interact with them because i could not help them or i would relate to how they were feeling and feel guilty over that or i would be afraid that their problems would make it harder for us to spend time together and feel guilty over that this happened several times over a few months and as i got over my crush it started happening less frequently until it stopped happening altogether now i have an online friend who i talk to pretty often but i am pretty sure they have much closer friends than me we met through a specific fandom and that is what we usually talk about sometimes this fandom can be hard for them to handle and they have taken extended breaks where they stop participating in it for a while and we end up not talking to each other as much when this happens i get really upset i have not gotten self destructive because of it but it reminds me of the crush i had three years ago i also feel like this when certain people do not come online for long periods of time i do not feel like this with everyone mainly with people i really like and admire the more recent feelings seem like they could just be me not wanting to lose my friends but i am still concerned that it could turn into a serious problem since it feels related to the crush thing i can manage my current feelings pretty well but i really do not want to get to the point where i self harm every time someone i care about posts something negative or does something that makes me think they do not care about me

when to seek help for a drinking problem
so this is going to be a bit of a long story so i will cut some corners for the sake of everyone s sanity the story starts with me getting a kinda crappy roomate he is incredibly annoying and all he does is play video games i am an incredibly tolerant person and help him try to fix some of his more annoying features cut to about 9 months later i move across country with my less annoying roommate to live with old friends me and my roommate i ll just call him tom get a job together in this new state we moved to after a while tom becomes worse off and my other roommates hate him this causes stress since i am always the mediator i should mention that i moved after losing my job and have pretty bad debt needless to say i end up falling for a coworker who is incredibly two faced she would say one thing to me and then manipulate the story she told to other people her backstory involved a lot of parental problems growing up now i am a very emotional person especially for a guy which is a byproduct of growing up with sisters and due to my weight problem and depression i have always been a social extrovert and continued to try to get this coworker over for parties before i knew what she was really like the irony is that she started coming over and going after one of my roommates as i was forced to watch her make advances on him not tom but another roommate and a childhood friend this of course was after her and i shared emotional thoughts and stuff so i was addicted to her at this point at this point in the story i hit an emotional brick wall due to stress of finances roommate arguments tom who at this point is unbearable and this coworker i had strong feelings for i could feel my emotions breaking under the weight of it all i lost a lot of weight quickly became cynical and more fiscally responsible somehow i had achieved everything i had ever wanted for myself as far as weight loss and fiscal responsibility go despite the depression i spent the next few weeks ignoring this coworker and pretending she does not exist i ignore her until she insists on having a talk with me she admits to me that she misses me and i have been mean lately and she has told me things she would not tell anyone else she says that our friendship is the most important thing to her she manages to sneak past all of my emotional defenses and start manipulating me once again this goes on for a while when i finally get so tired of everything that something breaks inside me and i have this overwhelming need to leave this is made worse by a party we have with my coworker and other friends the whole time i feel social anxiety something i am not familiar with and i just had to leave and felt so alone the party was at my house so i sat out in my car for hours on the phone with old friends i have never experienced any feeling like this before i have been depressed before but i am a social butterfly and love parties somehow i had developed a need to be alone something foreign to an extravert like myself within a week i moved across country again where i now reside with my parents while i get back on my feet all of this backstory is leading up to a question i have about my emotional wellness inside i feel empty not depressed or happy just like both emotions just are not there i feel oddly content overall but my social desires have plummeted and my parents and sisters think my behavior of going on random drives and talking to old friends for hours at a time are strange for me i find myself playing video games and having no desire to meet people i do have a job now but most people there think i am gay and i am fine with that so i have stood people up who i have met who want to bring me out drinking i find myself being a recluse and wanting to be alone i no longer seek women and typing this is the first time i have allowed myself to think about my old roommates in nearly a month is there something wrong with me i think i am emotionally or socially broken or something any advice or answers would be nice edit i should probably clarify that i am 100 straight i just dress fashionably for a guy so people assume
is this a bad thing
i have read the faq and it said i should seek out help if my problems stress me but these things do not exactly stress me but only after writing them down they do sound unhealthy a lot of my fears are laughable and embarrassing to admit i do have logic and understand that what i am doing is irrational and stupid but in the moment i am doing my stupid things i am not thinking that i am wondering that even though my small habits do not hurt me too much if i should still try and find help anyways to get some background i have been medically diagnosed gad i took medication for several years but it overall was ineffective so i stopped 1 1 2 years ago here s what is going on with my paranoia i check underneath my bed every time i enter my room to make sure nobody is hiding underneath there even though the space underneath is far too small for a person over the age of 5 to fit under i also check for cameras in my room in the shower i place a bottle over the black dot on the plastic curtain the one that keeps the water in in fear that it is actually a camera i will occasionally get up and walk around my room just to make sure nobody else is in there even if i have already checked i occasionally unplug my laptop and spin around so my back is up against the wall so if someone is in there they cannot see what i am doing and i will be able to see them if they move i will log out of skype for several hours at a time in fear that if i stay logged in my contacts may be able to see what i do on the computer screen watching porn is non existent in my world in fear of someone watching me i have difficulty talking to strangers online in fear that they are actually people who know me in real life who have tracked me down online and are just posing under a fake persona to try and get information off of me when i was visiting my grandparents this weekend who live in the country they have a big house with big windows and hardly any blinds i could not sit in front of a window at night in fear that i had be a clear target for a sniper or any maniac hiding in the woods with a gun that i could not see since it was pitch black outside at the same house i had trouble sleeping because i feared that the house itself was a clear target for any serial killer to come tonat night since you would be able to see the lights for miles on certain nights i keep my bedroom door open so i am not possibly alone in a room with some sort of maniac on other nights i keep my bedroom door closed so i am not open to any sort of maniac who may be outside the room i purposely sleep on my side with a thick layer of blankets over my neck so it cannot be exposed easily grabbed to anyone who may try to strangle me in my sleep those were the fears i could think of like i said most of these are just small bad habits i have i cannot even remember when they started but is it possible they can get worse if i ignore it should i seek help now
should i seek out help for this irrational paranoia
i am having trouble with remembering my emotions which include not being able to feel anything thinking back to past events i just get this nauseating feeling nothing more and it does not change whether it is good or bad memories it is not directly bad nor good since it does allow me to forget bad feelings simply by taking a nap but that is the same for good feelings i already have great problems feeling in general so when i do feel stuff it would be nice if it lasted longer than an hour is this normal i feel like i might be overreacting but i really do not know
cannot recalll or relive emotions

7 secret eating habits that may be signs of an eating disorder
i am 21 and male with bpd and i legitimately cannot get along with or empathize with anyone who is not also suffering from mental health issues when i try and talk to or befriend normal people i do not feel anything towards them at all legitimately nothing no attachment no sense of friendship nothing they just do not understand and all of their experiences feel so distanced from mine but while talking to other people suffering from mental illness i do not feel so empty anymore i can talk to them laugh with them and have meaningful friendships i have never had a relationship or anything because of these same issues regardless though i am at a point in my life where i feel very isolated have no one to talk to and am rapidly losing hope in ever finding anyone to talk to ever again there are no support groups or anything like that here so that is totally ruled out i just do not know where to meet people
how to meet more people with mental health issues
so i have suspected that i have some sort of mental illness for a while because while i am a generally positive person i constantly have these dark thoughts and feelings i am 16 right now and for while i have been having really bad panic attacks a few times the panic attacks in combination with the dark thoughts sort of built up inside me and it became too much after a lot of time spent convincing myself i told my mom about the panic attacks not the dark thoughts i am not nearly brave enough to speak about that yet and she said that we had ask the doctor about it the next time i had my physical i described to my family doctor what i had been going through and she suggested that i see someone better suited for this topic like a psychiatrist or someone who can prescribe medicine for this type of stuff my mom was there when i was talking to the doctor and after we left she asked if seeing a mental health professional was something i had want to do i said yes she then said she would look into it because she works in a pharmacy and has connections flash forward a couple months and my mom has not said anything about making me any type of appointment i thought okay maybe its just taking a while but i was close to hitting a low and i reaaaalllly wanted some help so i asked my mom and she said that she was still looking into it i got over my low and by this point i did not think my mom was in any hurry to get me to see a specialist and you have to understand that its not easy for me to bring up the topic i spend months going back and forth with my self weighing out the possible consequences so i was not in any hurry to remind her either then last year i hit a real big low i was kind of drifting in and out of reality and it was really scary i missed school for a few days and when i was not spaced out i was crying my parents were confused as to why i dropped the ball suddenly but i could not bring myself to tell them what was happening to me i just locked my door and hid from them all the ugly then i pulled myself together a little bit acted like it did not happen and you would not believe it they acted like nothing happened too i will say that my parents love me and my siblings very much i know that for sure but i am just not sure if they think its a phase or what i have always hid in my room when i feel any of the ugly coming out some maybe they do not believe it because they have not seen it i do not know but i do know that with every day that passes by i get more and more tired out waiting for help to come i have almost given up on asking for it my heart feels so heavy it hurts and i am almost physically being dragged down i am a good person a straight a honor student a cheerleader and an involved member of the community i know i have potential but i feel so burnt out what can i do to fix myself
please give me some advice
i am a freshman about to go onto the 2nd year of college i do not really go out of my way to ask for help and i do not know the reason why i am doing relatively well in school but not as well as i should be most of the time i just go out with friends or game excessively and i do not think about college that much i am getting pretty hard classes next semester and i am not even sure if i am going to be able to apply because i do not know how to apply for loans my friends know me and envy me for being calm and unstressed all the time but honestly just checking the college emails or going on the site to check for work or extra credit gives me the worst feeling ever the work is not hard i just get like that and i hate that about myself typing this makes me feel like a piece of crap but idk i do not know what is the deal with me and why i am like this i am smart i guess but i make the worst choices and i rely on my emotions and act on impulse i do not sleep enough and i do not do what i should to take care of my body i do not even know where to begin

i guess i have a bit of a story i had like to vent out trigger warning i guess i might seem insensitive or whatever to mental health issues block of text also incoming some backstory on me i suppose i used to think i was gay but over the past two years i am something more like pansexual i am out of the closet i guess but it is not really a fact most people know about me or would guess when i told some close friends nonchalantly they thought i was kidding story time there was a girl i dated for about two years and it was sort of on and off during that time her names not important privacy and such sometimes i broke up with her sometimes she broke up with me but we often kept together very early into the relationship about a month or two in she told me that she had a mental disorder called dissociative identity disorder i never really had a problem with it and thought that it would definitely be wrong to break up with someone because they had a disorder she had one alter who really just hated my guts and did his best to make me miserable but a lot of the other alters are people i had call my friends i never really thought that anything was wrong with her her having the disorder and alters was just kinda part of her i guess there was nothing else really wrong with her from what i could tell and i really liked her much later into the relationship she told me that when i asked her out she was suicidal and thinking about ending it everyday and that me appearing in her life had saved her i motivated her to be a better person to try and get a job to try and get her ged i also began to notice her panic attacks her overuse of pills and how she was when she did not have any she clinginess and other problems she has a really really hard life and she had always come to me with her problems to talk i never knew what to say i am really horrible at dealing with bad important things and am really bad at advising them all i could really say a lot of the time was that i am sorry when things were rough i had spend entire days trying to make her feel better by showering her with compliments reading up on what i should be doing and trying my best to emulate that and just in general working hard to make her feel better as i mentioned though her life was really hard i had be trying to make her feel better almost all the time and it was exhausting i had go through periods of my own hard times and i could not talk to her about them because she had it so bad for that reason i broke up with her a few times as previously mentioned eventually though she had seem better and i felt less exhausted and bottled up and she had ask for me to take her back and i always did after a few of these occasions and her breaking up with me too though i made it a rule in my head that we should stay broken up if it ever happens again about a month ago now i had say i decided i have been unhappy for a very long time all i feel is anger when she talks to me because of the exhaustion i mentioned i ended up breaking up with her but we remained friends i think she is overall just a very unhealthy person for me to date i still felt or feel things about her i do not know if its love i do not know what that feels like at all i guess i suppose i love her i want to hold her i want to make her smile i want her to be happy i want her to be mine but she started dating and made a tinder account literally the day we broke up and instantly appeared happier once again she bragged a lot about all the guys who thought she was so attractive and how she was going on so many dates that made me really angry i think it was jealousy mostly because i still do feel things for her two weeks later she begs for me to take her back i don t i asked for her to stop talking to me about who she was dating and stuff but its all she really talked about anymore she often did it in roundabout ways like coming to me for help coping when her mom called her a slut for getting a hickey on her first date with someone today she told me about her fucking a guy and i just got so angry i did not act on my anger i never do i just sort of bottle it up and feel it inside me whenever i am alone i decided i need a break from her to sort out my feelings and told her she freaked out on me and sent about a half hours worth of insults i do not know i am just very angry and sad whenever i am alone now when i am with people it is great but alone i am suffering i find it pretty hard to open up and pretty sure i do not really have any friends that are close enough to me for me to tell all this i do not even know what i want to hear back at this point from you people
i have been very angry recently do not have anyone i think i can talk to
my mom has been treated for chronic pain with opiates for over a decade i know that sentence alone raises a lot of flags but her spinal column was damaged in a car accident causing her to have two back surgeries including a fusion and is legally disabled she has also always been consciously aware and afraid of drug addiction she has never allowed her doctors to raise her doses however she just started this whole i have a parasite infection thing obsesses over having pictures of them has now stopped going to two doctors that told her she was not infected just paid to have a bunch of lab work done with no results and gets very upset and angry when someone even begins to suggest they are not real at first this really scared me but yesterday i googled her behavior and the description for delusional parasitosis is spot on to the tee i am actually somewhat comforted that she is not losing her mind and that this is a known side effect of opiate use i just do not know what the hell to do now and i am still very scared worried for her

i have had a lot of trouble with school work and studying these past couple years and i feel like it is getting worse i want to schedule an appointment for a psychologist or psychiatrist but i need the emotional support and insurance of my parents to do this i have very briefly mentioned that i think i might have adhd to my mom lack of motivation procrastination etc but she thinks that since my grades are alright that i am fine i hate how i barely finish assignments on time and how i cannot even sit still and study and this is going to get worse as college progresses even just thinking about doing assignments fills me with dread even though i know i can easily finish the assignment if i just sat down and did it but i am unable to just sit down and do it she also has said that her brother has adhd and my dad shows symptoms of it sometimes but i know he is not diagnosed so my final question is how can i confront my parents to say i think i need an appointment edit my parents just got home and my mom asked me how i was doing on my paper i have 1 page done out of 7 i said i do not know what is wrong and of course she just tells me i am being lazy and need to just sit down and do it this fills me with so much disappointment in myself and i have no idea what to do help

i am 24 and i have never had a girlfriend and i am honestly certain i am one of the most naturally unusual looking people i know my jaw is sunken in on itself which creates an awful squished effect where i have a disproportionately giant forehead but the bottom part of my face is totally shrunken and squared off it gives my face a very underdeveloped lopsided look i have asperger s and i am pretty sure my features are indicative of a developmental disability i went to a hair stylist to get a pretty expensive haircut but i feel like i still look like a total autistic loser my head is shaped in an extremely weird way that no style would look good on the pictures where you can see my whole body show how disproportionate i am people i know irl tell me they do not see anything strange about how i look and i am average looking not attractive or unattractive but i think i look awful every time i look in the mirror and it drives me insane i have posted on r amiugly and most of the people tell me i look normal but a few people told me i am ugly and they seemed a lot more sincere i have tried buying new clothes getting a nice haircut and none of it makes me look any better lipstick on a pig etc i have never benefited from the dating relationship advice i have read and i feel like it is not written with people like me in mind i am not too bad at talking to men but when i talk to women in any setting they seem awkward and uncomfortable i have posted about this before but i am feeling really anxious because i met a girl who i think seems cool but i am worried that if i talk to her she will just think i am an ugly creep how do i deal with it pics of me since people do not take my word for it
i am very strange looking and i have no idea how to deal with it i am afraid to be around other people and i have never had a girlfriend how do i deal with this pics included
i feel like i have to make a choice regarding what kind of person i want to be i recently went off fluoxetine and went on to seratraline the problem i had with fluoxetine was that i suspected it was making me feel unmotivated and emotionally numb it is early days with the seratraline admittedly but so far i have seen no change so now i am wondering if i should come off drugs completely but i am worried this will send me back to square one when my intrusive thoughts and anxiety were at their worst i also fear i may end up like i was before extremely oversensitive and emotional to the point where even the slightest negative comment towards me would hurt my feelings to but it basically i am torn between caring too much and not enough while i am here i also have some other advice to ask how can i stop being so self obsessed i am very self aware which makes it hard to socialise naturally ironically the more i worry about how i behave around people the worse i behave it is also just a headache frankly despite the fact i realise this i cannot seem to shake it off because trying not to be self aware is of course a form of self awareness in and of itself it is like saying don t think about elephants you cannot think of anything but elephants any advice

i have been consistently tense and restless for 5 moths and have trouble sleeping and reaching an orgasm i have talked to psychiatrists and doctors and none of them have an answer as to what is going on with me it all started when i was prescribed depakote risperidal celexa and abilify 5 months ago and a few weeks later these symptoms started i am considering asking my doctor for a referral to a neurologist to see if they can help me out
can somebody help me out
i mean i am a nice person i say good morning to strangers i say thanks for people who have thankless jobs i smile for strangers i will do any favor i can to make you happy but sometimes it is all just so heavy sometimes i just get tired of being good sometimes i just want to see the world crash and burn and see it all end in flames sometimes to implode everything to make the world feel as i feel inside because my heart is just so heavy and i do not even know why
everyone gets tired of the world sometimes
i am 20 and i just got my first real job at a dollar store it seems so insignificant and something i should have done a long time ago but it is a huge deal for me i had to work up a lot of courage for this a couple of years ago i had trouble asking for an extra ketchup packet my first day was on black friday and a 12 hour shift to boot while running the register i felt like every customer spoke a language that i only vaguely understand i ended up making a couple of pretty big mistakes luckily my manager is really awesome did not write me up and found a way to fix it she said that it was kind of their fault for starting me out on black friday yesterday they put me on freight they said it was because they figured i would be nervous but i really think they were afraid i would mess up again i did not mind freight does not talk so it was more comfortable to do i just cannot help but feel like my managers regret hiring me over someone more qualified i kind of lied on the test i knew i was not good in social situations but i would not get a job at all if i said that i really need this i really need the money and if i stay for 90 days i am eligible for dental and vision insurance which i do not currently have but need i just do not know if mentally i can handle it i hope it gets better i kind of feel like i need to see a professional but i am not totally sure of my insurance status come january i might not be covered and i definitely cannot afford it out of pocket i guess i am just looking for support if anyone would like to recall their first few days of work or just offer words of comfort i would appreciate it advice is appreciated as well thanks
i got a job but i am not sure if i can handle it
okay so back in april i gave myself a commitment to achieve to eat right quit smoking and work out for 180 consecutive days in a row including weekends no breaks in mid october i reached this goal but since then i have started to struggle started eating shit again not as bad as i used to but still not good only been making it to the gym a couple days a week i got really bummed over a girl a while back and once i made myself reach my promise point it is like i allowed that disappointment to finally kick in so now i have been drowning in depression struggling to keep the gym nutrition routine going kind of lost as to what i do about motivation i have some pretty difficult depression issues so some motivations will not work i am sick of living so alone though i feel like maybe i had be more motivated if i had something to work towards my confidence was raising but were shot down and reversed when things did not go well with that girl i like i get stuck on these things that adults usually don t i missed a stage in my childhood i think anyway what can help motivate me books i am kind of lost on the amount of protein i should be taking as i am trying to gain muscle and lose fat at the same time even emotional suggestions could help t hank you for reading
here i am now motivate me
a couple of years ago i went through a period of 6 days in which i was completely and utterly anxious and upset to the point of not being able to function i could not go to work i could not sit still i could not interact with people i could barely eat i could not even watch tv or switch on the computer the only thing i did was lay in bed and cried and the only thing that made me feel somewhat normal was going for a long drive i do not know what it was and it lifted as suddenly as it started it was 7 years ago and never happened before that or since i went to my doctors during it who gave me anti depressants but i never took them i did not feel depressed and they said it would take a few weeks to kick in but i felt i could not wait that long instead i spent time talking to the samaritans to feel like i was actually doing something to help i thought things like this occured whenever something bad has happened to someone or it is a reaction to something that happened however my life was great i had a great job that i loved i was with friends all the time my family is wonderful and i had no stresses and the biggest worry i had on my mind was where me and my friends were going to go on a friday night to this day i still wonder what was happening is it possible for someones brain and mental health to go just completely haywire for no other reason than it can
is it possible to have severe prolonged anxiety panic without any external causes
i live in a foreign country and do not have anyone to talk to where should i look for help online

so this girl is the love of my life incredibly easy to talk to and i have so much in common with her however she recently told me about how she regularly has thoughts of killing people hears voices and wishes death on her mother admittedly her mom is kind of a crazy bitch but i do not believe anyone deserves death she said that that is not even the half of it but she is improved since then she also told me about experiences where she is blacked out and gotten incredibly violent she claims these episodes have not happened since she was in high school however just a year ago she practically raped me held me down against my will and would not take no for an answer it got to the point where i started yelling at her and hitting her not violently do not want to seem like an abusive ass i could never harm anyone to get her to stop but no matter what i did she had a smile on her face after a while she came to and proceeded to cry and tell me stories of her blackouts including destroying rooms and at one point in her life strangling her dog didn t kill it just hurt it regardless not okay but she says she does not remember that happening she has this thing of repressing all of her bad memories to the point where she cannot remember them anymore i told her she should talk to a therapist about it but she is afraid she will be admitted and she does not want to have to rely on a pill to survive or be normal she out right refuses to go i do not know what to do guys i do not want to break up with her but at the same time should i stay with someone in an unstable mental health like on the surface she seems normal however she started telling me all of this last night and it really unsettled me i have kind of just ignored it until last night when i learned her wanting to murder her mother was genuine and not just her in a bad mood she says she would never act on it she says it is a way for her to let off steam by fantasizing about it still though does not seem super healthy to me tl dr should i stay with someone if they are mentally unstable and refusing to get help even i love them
so might be severally mentally ill and i need some advice

i want to be numb to life i want to be emotionless and cold i do not want emotions i do not want hate love or any of that shit i am tired of life and committing suicide will not solve anything because my soul still lives and god the shitty bastard who created me will judge it i am sick of being good for no reason i am sick of the fact that our world still exists so what can i do to spiritually mentally and emotionally to corrupt myself being sinful sounds like too much work just as much work as being good how can i force my soul to suicide

i am not going to tell you that i have adhd or anything other than what my dr told me a few years ago i was diagnosed then with depression anxiety i was prescribed effexor xr and it is really helped but i am still having very specific problems that i find extremely exhausting to try and tell anybody about i cannot commit myself to anything i can read a book but that is about it if i am not doing something different every ten minutes i have a new hobby every one or two months sometimes every couple of hours i am not having any problems with suicidal thoughts but i do have general feelings of unworthiness i fight sleep because i feel like i am just wasting time i should also mention that i am prescribed klonopin which helps me in social situations and makes me sleepy i sometimes cannot stop talking though not incoherently i just talk sometimes i cannot work myself up to even say hi to my dad in the morning and will not talk all day then at the flip of a switch i will be in a talking mood again i am not a very sad person just sometimes i am intensely interested in something then i am intensely disinterested in everything i love my wife and my children dearly and i know that i am hurting them when i go into my hiding hole and will not talk much i hate myself for this and i know how hard it is for them i need something to constantly keep me going for instance when the cubs were on their world series run i was great that whole time and rode the high off of the win for a while then i was back to normal me i have never been through anything traumatic was never abused never did drugs except painkillers and weed for about two years the painkiller use was light i do not even like alcohol i am an empty person inside not a psychopath i feel intense affection for my loved ones but it is showing it that is the problem i can show it to my wife and children but that is it not even my own brothers i cannot even tell them i love them and they have never done anything to hurt me i have no love for money or power i do have general and consistent interests baseball specifically the cubs jesus christ i m not hearing voices i am a true believer of jesus and attend a very loving and helpful church that has helped me pipe tobacco and hearthstone in bouts but then sometimes i just lose interest in it all i literally want to sit in a chair and stare at a wall sometimes until i fall asleep i want to take my day off monday which is my optional scheduled day off but i cannot make any decisions and try to pressure others into making the decisions for me a very nasty trait of mine i just do not know what is wrong with me but i know something is i am not out of touch with reality i just feel like i have no identity or long term goals or motivation i am afraid to see the doc because even though he is a wonderful dr i am pretty sure he will just think i am under stress i m not and up my dosages writing this made me feel better i know it is a bit rambling and whiny but it helped to show how much different my mood will be tomorrow i would not be suprised if i just deleted this whole thing as soon as i wake up i just need input advice anything i am sorry for taking so much of your time but i am so grateful you lent it to me
really struggling and at a loss here
hey i have been having a lot of mental health problems since the start of this year and have decided i should probably see a doctor but as the waiting list is so long wondered if anyone would be able suggest what i might have so i can maybe get some short term relief or at least an understand how to cope i was diagnosed with anxiety at 9 and depression at 14 and have taken meds for years but this is quite a separate problem symptoms hearing do not hear people talking directly to me or long delays in understanding and responding hear noises that are not happening e g knocking on doors running up and down stairs creaking of doors occasional nonsensical voices feeling dazed confused foggy detached from current situation hard to maintain a conversation severe trouble maintaining one line of thinking feeling of flatness as if everything is happening very far away or is muted touch often a loss of sensation in fingers e g if i was not looking at my hands i would not know i was touching something if i close my eyes i feel as though i am floating and become very unsteady a lot of brain fog simultaneously lack of boundary awareness never know if i am standing too close or too far away from someone because everything feels like it is miles away anyway memory hard time remembering to do things i have been asked e g at work school often cannot remember how i got somewhere what i was doing or what i was thinking about very bad memory often repeating things many times over because i do not know if it is been said or done have to ask many times what needs doing and will need recapping a lot large gaps in memory both long and short term often unable to categorically say something was real or definitely happened so yeah any insight into wtf is wrong with me would be really good cos this is really starting to scare me feel as if i am genuinely loosing my mind sorry if any of this did not make sense but coherency is not a strength rn tldr feeling spacey af hearing noises awful memory cannot tell what is real and what is not anymore
any insight into what this could be
i have got a lot going on in my head and i had like to be able to sit with a therapist once a week and be able to talk about my past and also some of the feelings behaviours i am struggling with presently do i need to get a diagnosis from a psychiatrist first or can i call a therapy office and just walk in ideally i had like to not be diagnosed with anything due to stigma i live in ontario canada for reference
do you need a diagnosed mental illness in order to access therapy
i grew up in a very conservative home and there were plenty of things i reasonably did not like but the problem is that i have always wanted to do the exact opposite of what i was taught even things that were very appropriate i do not know if i have ever 100 thought for myself this epiphany happened shortly after moving away at 19 there were not anymore restrictions and it gave me the opportunity to finally begin finding myself on the side though i feel so sad and angry i was so focused on being the opposite of what my conservative family believed in i wanted to make sure everyone knew i was obnoxiously opinionated narcissistic and a liar trying to make everyone believe the picture being painted these realizations were beneficial as i began to learn from my mistakes but now at 21 i am incredibly insecure about myself before leaving home i did have some friends but it took me moving away to realize they were assholes who used me and made fun of me behind my back trying to avoid any experiences like that to happen again i always remind myself not to be too nice to people and to be neutral unless the time and the place calls for otherwise but i have developed a lot of social anxiety being around people because all i have ever been was too nice to everyone so i spazz and it is like i do not know how to even act around people which makes my peers in my new town which is supposed to be my fresh start think i am weird do not take me seriously how do i love myself when i have lied to myself for the first 19 years of my life
how do you learn to love yourself when you contributed to everything you were against your whole life

need help figuring out how to help a loved one
i have severe social troubles and anxiety i used to think it was just social anxiety because i am so afraid i cannot even make myself talk but at times i am reminded why i ended up in that state of mind and it is basically because i tend to lose myself or sort of my composure when i do things when i am observing signals are mostly clear to me like what people say what it means you know cognition but as soon as i go and use my body somehow or talk it is like something motor skill related happens and a second or two after i am done talking and this is almost every time i realize what i have said after i am done talking but not as i am doing it in short i find it incredibly hard to use my speech as an action because it is almost as if i can only think one thing at a time i cannot hold legit conversations that follow a chain of logic where you argue back and forth even knowing how arguing works in theory because i do not have a good sense of myself in the second i am talking but only afterwards i am able to process what i just did and i mention composure because this also extends to physical things i may play around with a ball or play guitar i am good for maybe the first 5 or so minutes but soon i lose composure and get reckless sort of if it is guitar i may start missing all the cues all of a sudden even though i did excellent just moments ago and if it is physical activity i may get so immersed in that thing i am doing that it starts looking weird from the outside people may think it s too much and i can sense that as soon as i fade back into consciousness a second after i am over it i do not know what this is i have sometimes thought it is like dysparxia could also be adhd of some sort i hope it is not aspergers i have been this way my whole life did not realize how far from normal i have been until the last couple of years of my life closest resemlance i have seen out there is probably thom yorke from radiohead something about his performance is a little freaky as if he lets himself get carried away until his facial expressions look really strange and he starts shaking his head too much from rhythmically appropriate to erratic and that is a good example of how i feel when i do things it makes living hard because with social anxiety that stems from that and being judged for all my mistakes i feel like i have to tiptoe about everything when i am around people and i can never just do something the way i would do it becuase i fear people will find it to look or sound off putting due to my lack of composure
i lose self consciousness when i do things i think it is a motor skill problem
just a heads up this is mostly a rant and will probably end up turning out really crappy and poorly written let me start by saying that almost everyone in my family has some form of mental illness i received my bipolar disorder and some anxiety issues from my mom as well as recent signs that point to developing auditory schizophrenia all of my other relatives three brothers and a sister have one mental illness or another it is considered more strange to not have one than it is to be completely crazy my mom grew up with three sisters and two brothers her father was abusive and her mother was purposely oblivious to my grandfather s actions he was only abusive towards my mom which caused her to develop many of the phobias and mental issues she has now when she married my dad and became pregnant with with her fourth child my younger sister my grandfather had threatened to kill her when she was born but he died before she was before my youngest brother was born five years after the first four of us my mom was admitted into a psych ward after having a mental breakdown they proceeded to try to make her better by using shock therapy but it did not help much she was released and continued to raise us she did her best at being a parent but she was far from the perfect mom one of the things she had the most trouble with was seeing if something was wrong we all went through phases when we were young where we would lie or do things to get attention but i was the worst i will willingly admit that i was a little asshole when i was a kid i would constantly lie about almost anything to get attention to the point where my parents started to think i may be a compulsive liar when i was ten i was molested by the sixteen year old brother of one of my closest friends and told my mom even though he threatened to kill me if i told anyone instead of trying to help me she yelled and grounded me for a month for lying about something so horrible i may have lied about almost everything but i never lied about anything like that looking back i do not blame her for not believing me if i was her i probably would not have believed me either she did the best she could with raising five psychotic little monsters and dealing with a recurring alcoholic for a husband shortly after her and my dad divorced my mom decided she wanted to go back to college she was already in her late thirties and still had my youngest brother to take care of but she had been going to college to become a nurse before my first brother was born and wanted to go back now that all but one of us was out of school she started out at a new college that i cannot remember the name of but eventually transferred to kettering college a school that my great aunt works at and helped her get into she had been working hard and was making it through her classes until she got to algebra no matter how hard she tried she could not get get a passing grade she did the class over to the point that she had to start paying out of pocket to go to the class again a week before thanksgiving she met with the school counselor to talk to her about taking the class again because she had to send a request to take it again to whoever is in charge of that stuff the counselor talked to her about it and told her not to lose any sleep over it since she was confident that she would be accepted into the class since she had high grades for all her other courses she asked my mom if she had any health issues or anything and when she found out about her many mental illnesses her attitude towards her completely changed she started talking to her like she would snap at any moment and like she was dealing with a spooked animal two days before thanksgiving she met with two other women who work with the counselor who told her she had been denied the chance to try taking the class again they proceeded to tell her that due to her grades being low she would not be able to take any of the main courses at the college all of her grades were the highest you could get for all except algebra they treated her the same way the counselor had treated her she is now trying to figure out what she is going to do now that she is been told she cannot come back i have tried to tell her she can always go into phlebotomy since she passed the course for it but she does not know if she will be able to since it is been a while since she took the course when she first started at kettering college i was skeptical they are a seventh day adventist based school and we are catholic they are extremely closed minded about mental illnesses for a college for becoming nurses and doctors i have seen people with worse grades and attitudes about college that are given better treatment because they have no health issues and follow the same religion and this is where my rant ends i am not really sure how to end this since i have not actually written anything like this before so i am sorry if it kind of sucks i just needed somewhere to rant and get this out
my mom was kicked out of school for having mental illnesses
as the title says i restart everything i do most of the time without even finishing it first i do this with games a lot and with books both for academic and fun purposes sometimes when i do this i catch some questions drifting across my mind questions like am sure that i understood that i should go back what if i missed something what if am reading too fast what if at the end of the book i did not understand what the autor tried to say if i proceed i will remember this part of course anxiety rises after each one i do not know if this even has a name but any help would be appreciated thanks
i restart everything games books etc
i met this guy not too long ago and he is honestly everything i had look for he is sweet to me and those around him if not a little shy and easy to talk to has a generally good personality the whole good shebang the only thing is i have officially had severe anxiety and mild depression since my junior year of high school i graduated this last june my anxiety affects me much more on a day to day basis and when it comes to people i talk to everyday like this guy i just have to be able to check in from time to time because i establish habits quickly and worry regularly about them we have already established we really like each other and we both know about our mental illnesses and are willing to try a long distance relationship as we live in different countries for now the distance does not bother me as much but of course some days are not good days for him and those days my mind goes into hyperdrive because he typically wants some space and that is fine but that disrupts my being able to check in to make sure he is okay if there is anything i can do say to distract him or anything like that i guess i am afraid that it will become too much to handle for us despite how much we like each other he tends to shut down on his bad days but growing up i have been forced to pretend everything s okay and then word vomit what is in my head the few i feel comfortable with but he typically does not like heavier serious conversation from either of us so he either ignores it or tells me it is too much to talk about so i feel like it does not matter even though i know that is not what he is trying to convey any advice general or specific i mean i could really use it
i have severe anxiety and mild depression ought i date someone with moderate depression

my mom has struggled with depression and schizophrenia since she was in her 20 s she is 74 now over 50 years of fighting the demons within but she is never given up and through all of it she is the kind gentle woman i remember and love from my childhood did she have bad days bad months even bad years hell yes literally hell when the voices in your head are so strong that you ask people around you if this is real am i making sense you know it is getting bad when she tries to talk but she is in so much mental anguish she can barely push out the words and it sounds like someone is pushing on her lungs so hard she cannot get a deep breath it is bad but then she breaks through on a better day and she is calling me to ask me how i am doing she is writing letters to family and friends to encourage them she is pushing herself to be a helper in any way she can even in the confines of her senior s home and she is never lost her faith sometimes the angels she talks to are not real but there are days i have to wonder if her connection is not stronger than i might ever know she is amazing because i think most people would have given up years ago but she won t because she is my mom and she is a hero do not give up my friends there are people who are looking up to you even as you struggle on
you know who is a hero people who deal with big mental health issues every single day for decades and win

so i think this is important i got hit by a car today nothing really serious just a sprained ac joint but still i got hit by a car and yet i could not stop thinking what a great day it was my depression has been pretty well in check and i realized everything is better than depression and it is shitty because when i was depressed if i said i was depressed i tend to get less people who give half a shit than saying i got hit by a car even if i emphasize the minor nature of the accident but depression is a shitload worse than being hit by a goddamn car and i think most people do not realize that and i am not saying depression needs boatloads of sympathy but i am saying that people need to take it seriously hopefully this gives someone a little bit of perspective maybe it is because the extraordinary circumstance of being hit by a car catches your attention and because depression seems so nebulous and seems so hard to distinguish from just being sad but less people think you are okay when you get hit by a car than when you are depressed and i can say from my own experience that i am unequivocally less okay when i am depressed than i am after i went head over heels thanks to a careless driver tl dr i got hit by a car getting hit by a car is better than depression

i had a manic episode and bought a car i can afford the payment but not the gas
this is seriously fucked up and i am having a horrible time processing everything so i kind of just wanted to vent yesterday i went to pick up my friends at their apartment and found their neighbor hanging from the railing of his balcony it took me a moment to even process what i was seeing i dialed 911 and then ran upstairs to get my friends there was nothing that could be done it was too late after the longest 5 minutes of my life the police and medics arrived to secure the area and get him down his kid came home shortly after that crisis workers came to the apartment to debrief with us about what we had seen and offer support i had a plan to kill myself three months ago to the day and had gotten about halfway through the pills i was going to take before i realized that someone would find me and their life would be seriously fucked up i went to the hospital spent a week in the psych unit on a 2 md hold and 2 months of day hospitalization i have had a long history of major depression anxiety and ptsd i know how it feels to be at the point where you have to end the suffering i feel for him but i also feel a lot of anger toward him and feel awful for feeling that way if i had not found him it would have been his kid or the lady downstairs who opened her door to see what all the screaming was about and found this guy literally hanging a few feet from her door i see his dead face everywhere i cannot sleep i cannot eat i see his fixed blown pupils on everyone i do not know this guy and he is everywhere i do not know how cops ems personnel deal with shit like this on a regular basis i really don t how do you get through trauma with prior mental health issues

i have borderline personality disorder and i have heard so many times people warning others to stay away from people like me we are total psychos crazies fucking mental i have seen so many times people writing that i do not deserve love respect or even a right to live this is exhausting but i am not that we are not all psycho stalkers or manipulative bitches and i believe even them have the right to live yes our illness does not excuse the abuse we may commit not at all and you have the right to hate your ex who manipulated you but remember that when you say don t date people with bpd you are also hurting innocent people who happen to suffer from the illness i always try to see the positive things even in my illness i may experience sadness or anger in an extremely intense way but i also experience happiness in a way few people will and i have a lot of empathy so much it can be funny sometimes but it is getting so hard to stay that way when so many people are reminding you that you are worthless because you share an illness with their ex or mother again i am not a stalker and i try my hardest to not manipulate tho i will admit i sometimes do without realizing i really try so hard to recover to not be an obsessive abusive bitch as so many people have called me i am just an 19 y o girl who sometimes stay up at night in order to create a whole new languages because i am feeling happy and motivated and who will choose the saddest looking plush to make it happy and it is unfair for you to tell me that i do not deserve love or that i should be euthanized the you refers to the people who have told me this shit not to the people reading this you are probably a nice person you who are reading this

should mental health issues be discussed at school

i will leave this here
this sub is a big source of fear and anxiety for me the reason is that the general attitude is that mental health professionals are always right no matter if they are not helping making things worse or abusing you people who have been horribly abused by mental health professionals are usually told that either they deserved it or that that is just how things are because more or less crazy people do not matter i understand that this is not the sub for us to sit around and say everything is shit constantly and it helps people a lot more to say here s what you can do to fix your situation feelings rather than just do not do x but when people post here complaining about being mistreated or abused they should not be treated like their experiences did not matter the thing is that there are so many gaping holes in the mental health field people who need help are falling through the cracks and people who need specific care are getting a different kind of care that makes things worse and people who are people and deserve basic human rights are being treated like prisoners for no good reason we as a community need to address these problems not sweep them under the rug or make excuses for them they re professionals they know what is best is not the appropriate response for someone concerned about being forcibly drugged or someone who was verbally abused by a therapist or someone who has experienced something horribly traumatic at the hands of professionals i say this because i was abused by mental health professionals multiple times i have ptsd and this leads to lot of crippling fear and paranoia i cannot be treated for it because my fears are rational and all of the decent read not throwing things at clients not cussing me out for crying not violating hippa law etc not just the people i agree with therapists i have seen about it say that there is nothing they can or will do to try to make me stop having rational fears you know what sucks pretty much my only option is either to off myself or to drug myself to the point that i do not even know who i am anymore just to make the fear stop i do not want to do either of those things of course but those are my options you know what sucks worse that i come here wanting a community that will understand and agree that clients deserve a voice in their care and get shat all over of course this is not everyone but it is a large enough portion of this subreddit that people pm me saying that they agree with what i have to say but are too afraid to comment because of the hostility some members here so yeah that is why i am unsubscribing

am i a sociopath psychopath
i said to my gp that i had taken various online questionaires and many had shown high probability of a mental illness he essentially told me theyre all bullshit and lies i mentioned to a nurse when i had my assessment that i had be doing research and believe i may have bipolar or a personality disorder i still believe and all he said was that i had been self diagnosing and it was likely normal teen mood swings sometimes i feel like the best thing you do is find out yourseld what the problems are but medical proffessionals dont seem to like being told they like to do it themselves and then get it wrong because they assumed a picture that wasnt true appararently i dont need help from an eating disorder team because i had felt more improved the days beforehand when really that was hypomania and a few days after i went right back to anorexia esque behaviour fuck doctors they listen to the things they want to know rather than tackling the big things you want them to help with
why do doctors seem to dislike any form of productive self help

9 bad habits that impact mental health
so i m black and over the past few days i have seen and heard of more shootings i just do not understand why it is so hard to see why black people are hurting there is always an excuse they should not have done whatever it was stalled in the middle of the road waited for their son on the bus run away lay on the ground with their hands in the air complied it just feels like there is nothing a black person can do to prevent being shot by the police although the police have no trouble de escalating situations or bringing in white people who give the police an even harder time and no all police are not bad cops but they become bad cops when they fail to protect people from other bad cops why is that so hard to understand honestly what is the point of living if i can get pulled over and end up dead seeing cops make me shake i am so fearful but angry at the same time is this ptsd i am definitely depressed and i have to go into these spaces filled with white people for school for work and nothing no discussion about what is happening in the world nothing i am walking around on edge tearful and heartbroken and someone is asking me if i watched the fucking emmy s have you seen the fucking news am i not supposed to care or be hurt when people are dying that look like me and the only common denominator is that we are black i am probably going to get such a negative rating for this but i do not care you are killing us physically mentally this shit affects our mental health constantly being demeaned and told that your pain is invalid is the most isolating fucking thing in the world and this shit hurts like hell
white people make me feel like i am going crazy
this is mostly just a vent as i have never actually had someone i could explain everything to but i would not say no to any advice on how to deal with this that does not treat me like i am some serial killer bent on filling the horrific void in my soul with the screams of children firstly i do not want anything relating to sociopaths on any sort of medical record so i have never bothered to get officially diagnosed however it is definitely something to do with emotions and morals i have a very difficult time internalizing morals and normal emotion an example would be if i saw some sort of news report on a shooting in a mall i had understand people are going to be upset but i feel nothing of the sort and i do not understand why people are upset an example of how i fail to internalize morals is that objectively i know something like let us say cannibalism is wrong i have no desire to eat someone because i see no point but if it ever became a necessity i would not hesitate as i do not really get why everyone is against it as much as they are i do not think i am fully sociopathic though if that is what is going on since i am pretty sure i can feel affection i am dating a guy right now and i honestly think i do love him unlike all my former friends i am not sure i could just cut off all contact with him and move on with no regrets as i have done before i also know i seriously lack empathy i can fake it to an extent and i know when i am supposed to feel bad for someone but the emotions just never come to me and i hate trying to comfort people since i find it very awkward and boring to fake caring but at the same time understand i cannot just go i do not care and leave them alone i have never felt guilty about lying to people that i can remember even my current boyfriend though i very carefully never do anything he had be furious devastated about if he caught me lying as i know guilt would never drive me to confessing is not spared from how i lie even when i am caught any regret i feel is usually over being caught and wishing i could go back and change how i lied so as to avoid it i am pretty good with knowing when to not talk about something at my office i know not to talk about all the creepy murdery things i have seen online and i never mention how i do not get why everyone is upset over some dead people but faking normalcy is exhausting and a huge reason for why i am so anti social and anti interaction since i have to work so hard with maintaining an air of sanity i am always exhausted about social interaction which has led to me dropping out of two separate colleges within the first week of term and i try to shy away from anything involving spending a lot of time near people which has definitely made my life difficult i would truly love any advice on either how i can deal with this without having probably going to totally be a serial killer in my medical records or ways to better understand internalize emotions and morality

tinder is bad for your mental health say scientists
i am not sure whether this is normal for a girl her age i know most people going through puberty are insecure but i feel like this is starting to get unhealthy and i want to end it before it becomes too much of a problem she is 12 years old and underweight for her age she gained no weight between two gp visits which is worrying she s going through her growth spurt she has voiced her concern at a number of occasions about how she thinks he is fat ugly ect however she will often ask my dad if a certain bit of food will make me her fat what made me worried enough to post this was when the topic of gaining weight came up again i asked her how she felt about it and she said i am fat i then asked her if she felt hungry which she said was a lot and then i managed to get her to say that she felt good by not eating this is scaring me she seems open to the idea of gaining weight for now but i am not sure how long this will last i feel like i need to stop it before it becomes a complete compulsion do you know how i could talk to her i know that saying you are not fat will not work or convince her and for most people its deeper than believing you are overweight possible causes could be that she has very few friends scared that people are looking at her at school and sometimes afraid of going to school due to teachers being loud she has senstitive hearing or some unnamed reason bullying may not be out of the question but i have asked her and she hasmentioned nothing
i think my sister may be developing an eating disorder
i am afraid that the girl i have been dating for almost a year might have bpd borderline personality disorder i am very frustrated and need someone with experience on this topic to help me out couple of days ago i felt that my relationship with my girlfriend is getting worse as she tries to unknowingly but intentionally abuse me more often her mood swings really badly and can jump from bad to good in just under 10 seconds literally she often insist and persuade me to do the things she does not really want like meeting up later due to inconveniece issue and when i finally accept it its a nightmare as i mentioned earlier these symptoms are getting much worse recently so i went on google in search for some of the possible described condition she might have i started on a website that wrote people with these abusive behavior may develop or already have bpd with examples of the general behaviors people with this condition have at first it was unconvincing but i still read on and also researched on other several pages because the more i read the more i feel there is some similarity i took an online bpd test and answered all of the quizzes using my knowledge of her behavior and the result was 34 severe her symptoms that i know of that are similar to the ones listed on the pages i researched on are as follows extreme reactions including panic depression rage or frantic actions to abandonment whether real or perceived she had tried to break up with me at least 2 times a week for couple of months for weird reasons like she behaved badly i will probably leave soon anyway so she will be the one the make the move or somewhere along that line this went away because we had an agreement a pattern of intense and stormy relationships with family friends and loved ones often veering from extreme closeness and love idealization to extreme dislike or anger devaluation she always fight with everyone she is close to including her best friend her mom and me she once broke away from her best friend that she idealize so much for months just because her friend did not give her enough company that she did not ask for distorted and unstable self image or sense of self which can result in sudden changes in feelings opinions values or plans and goals for the future five minutes everything is fine ten minutes later and it is a freaking mayday one day i can play video games in front of her the next day i get mad at just by telling her that i will turn on my computer recurring suicidal behaviors or threats or self harming behavior such as cutting i saved her from suicide once or maybe twice not sure if this is the case intense and highly changeable moods with each episode lasting from a few hours to a few days this one is dead on chronic feelings of emptiness and or boredom she does not say this out as often now as we have an agreement going on but before the agreement she always say things like everyone is against me i m so alone nobody understands me everything is so empty etc when she is in the anxious or depressed state of mood swing inappropriate intense anger or problems controlling anger she often blame the weather for this because it is always 30c here but again weather should not be the reason she gets mad at me having stress related paranoid thoughts or severe dissociative symptoms such as feeling cut off from oneself observing oneself from outside the body or losing touch with reality when very stressed or anxious he often lie in bed saying the keyword that got her in the mood over and over again with her eyes wide open unstoppably creeps me out big time now to the real question 1 are her symptoms likely to be bpd is it just me or is it other condition 2 if she has to seek professional help how can i convince her to do so she instantly go off when i say she needs help from a professional and inisist that she is fine 3 would these symptoms come back again after treatment sorry for the ridiculously long thread i just hope someone may be able to help me here i am genuinely very frustrated
my girlfriend might have bpd needs experienced advice

here s my most recent piece i posted about my personal battle with an eating disorder feel free to read it
long story previously i have posted in fair detail how i have been struggling with my bipolar ptsd and gad being so out of control that i am on short term disability and fmla concurrently until now there was otherwise radio silence because i went to a private mental health hospital that also offers out patient services to hopefully enroll in an intensive outpatient program things did not quite go according to plan after my intake evaluation they thought it was best to admit me as full in patient i was experiencing symptoms of psychosis and apparently a concerning amount of suicidal ideation mostly i consented for medication management purposes as i said i was discharged a week later to pick up partial patient care the next day from there everything went south i asked my mom to pick me up because i genuinely wanted to see her she apparently thought i was asking because my boyfriend who tries to avoid driving due to too many traumatic car accidents did not want to come get me she called him and ripped him a new one for a solid 20 minutes after she picked me up she decided to lecture me that i deserve better than what my boyfriend has to offer me i tried explaining that without his support in all meanings of the word emotional mental financial etc i would not have made it as far as i have she told me what we have is no more than a business arrangement and compared my year and a half long relationship to her 16 year one which is just unrealistic i was completely blindsided by this because she has never had an issue with him before so i think she just had something going on herself but when we got to my apartment and it was messy but within my regular standard of living admittedly lower than hers she continued her lecture and made sideways jabs at my boyfriend who was present but not participating because it was a family matter and would have made a long term problem my twin sister who lives with me has an estranged relationship with my mother and our relationship was only functional because she owes me for rent and stuff the only reason she lives with me is because my mom turned her back on her anyway my sister put herself in the middle of the argument the two of them are just fuel to each other s fires and i kept trying to send my sister away but she kept coming back at some point my mom started recording everything so she had some indication that things were going to get ugly but did nothing to defuse the situation eventually the situation escalated to the point my sister came storming out of her room and threw two pill bottles at us and said i took 13 of each so i tried to send her to get room again while my mom dialed 911 she refused and said she was leaving so i blocked the door so she tried to jump off my balcony but my mom pulled her back my mom yelled at my boyfriend to grab her but i told him to let her go and i ran after her i followed my sister for a half mile before i lost track of her but was able to flag down one of the cops looking for her and provided her last known location the whole walk home i did not know what was happening and if she was found when i got home my mom hugged me and the first thing she asked me was you know what this is do not you i was and still am furious with her she nearly lost a daughter and i my twin sister and the first things out of her mouth were vindictive and accusatory then she shot my boyfriend a death stare to which i called her out on between her and me he is responsible to answer to me no matter the stakes at that time i dismissed myself to go inside but my mom insisted i stay outside with the her and the officers i was confounded and asked what could they possibly need me for mind you at this time i had no idea on the situation with my sister so i complied to give my statement at that time then they finally told me they had my sister and she was cooperating so my sister was at the hospital demanding my mom acknowledge her mental health issues as seriously as she does mine while in the same breath refusing to be med compliant so the behavioral health unit refused to accept her in their wing then she goes on facebook and twists her story to make it sound like her attempt was related to a trauma she suffered three years ago which obviously is not the case i full heartedly believe my sister has borderline personality disorder i had to make the hard decision to immediately revoke my sister s and my living arrangement and she is no longer welcome unless she is gathering her things and either my boyfriend i are present from a therapeutic standpoint i am processing everything well so i do not have regrets about my actions and i recognize the stages of grief as they come and go but i know i am traumatized still so i am am frustrated i am going to therapy i am going to group therapy and all that good stuff but there is just no stopping this process so i am at a loss of what to do in the meantime
short story on the same day i returned home from a mental hospital my twin sister tried to kill herself so i kicked her out of my home
i have been getting more and more frustrated with the amount of knee jerk ableism that seems to have become engrained into popular language i know that 90 of the time the people using these words do not know the connotations regarding what they are saying however each and every time i cringe at the least and sometimes actually get pretty offended some of these words and phrases are used so much on a day to day basis by not just my friends family and coworkers but in the media as a whole news books tv shows movies it is everywhere i am not going to list them all as you all know what i mean but how do you deal with it do you bring people up on it and try to educate or are you not as upset by i as i am and leave it aside and not let it wind you up anyway thought it would be a good conversation what have you got to say x

i have gone to two walk in doctors to try to get some anti anxiety meds i have mentioned ativan because i hear it is the easiest one to get since it apparently does not have the same history of abuse like valium and xanax and apparently it is not quite as strong as those either the first doctor i saw just laughed at me for even asking but before sending me on my way he suggested i take some antidepressants and gave me a list of ones to consider and told me to come back once i have decided on one that i felt the most comfortable with of course i left and did not come back the second doctor i saw seemed more sympathetic and asked me more questions i did not mention ativan because i was laughed at the previous time and i did not want to just come off looking like i just wanted drugs cuz i did not want them to think i just want to abuse them instead i just used the term anxiety meds he ended up referring me to a mental health clinic and gave me a prescription for escitalopram aka lexapro cipralex i threw the prescription out because i do not want to be on antidepressants i was under the impression i was going to be sent to a psychiatrist but apparently i just ended up seeing a counselor at the mental health clinic i have seen him several times now and it basically has just felt like a waste of time the only reason i have continued to see him is because he set me up to see a psychiatrist through the clinic i saw that psychiatrist today finally and talked about a whole lot of stuff first focusing on my anxiety then delving into my personal life and upbringing although i feel like i was very clear about my anxiety i feel like i kinda hit a wall with him because he seemed to think that drugs were not the best thing for me at least not benzos he seemed like the kind of psychiatrist who is very careful with prescribing drugs but he still thought it was not that bad of an idea to represcribe me escitalopram i feel like he was concerned that i was going to be using ativan too much even though i made it clear that i do not get anxiety attacks that often like once or twice a month maybe even less however they are horrible and can go on for hours so i wanted something so that i do not have to experience and anxiety attack anymore i made it clear that most of my anxiety is social anxiety and i made it clear that i can deal with most of it even though i do not like it but there are situations like making important phone calls or job interviews etc where my anxiety it too strong that i usually just avoid those situations thus do not get ahead in life so seeing as i am not in those situations on a daily basis and often not even on a weekly basis there should not be concern for me overusing them and getting addicted i feel like he somehow thought that i have more general anxiety that is quite constant but i don t for the most part i am quite relaxed on my own or with friends and even though i feel a little anxious going shopping or working i can tolerate that anxiety and would not consider popping an ativan in those situations i was super clear about the frequency of my anxiety and what situations i feel like i could benefit from a benzo and how i feel like many situations i could manage the anxiety without anything anyways that psychiatrist was apparently just a one and done type thing apparently i most likely will not seem him again and quite frankly i do not really want to felt like a waste of time he got to know very personal things about me things even my family does not know and although he seemed sympathetic i do not think he actually understood my anxiety in that short session apparently he and my counselor seem to think i am doing great just because i am currently working however it is just a seasonal job that i have been working for the past 3 years and my anxiety prevents my from finding work in the off season thus i am not moving forward in my life i do not think this is acceptable for a 25 year old male and it blows my mind they think i should be proud of that sure it beats not working at all but it is hardly something to be proud of another thing i gathered from the meeting was that girls tend to acquire benzos more easily than men they did not admit to being sexist or anything but when i mentioned that i know numerous girls who take ativan and one who takes klonopin and all they did was see a random doctor and yet i have gone through all these hoops and still cannot get ativan i also mentioned that i have read on this subreddit about how people have gotten benzos quite easily they admitted that men tend to have a harder time because it is assumed they are more likely to abuse a drug i could not believe it when they said it it was so damn sexist but being my quiet anxious self i did not speak up about how ridiculous that sounded anyways i feel like i am back at square one apparently the psychiatrist will send records of my visit with him to my family doctor he said i could see him and ask about ativan he did say he was not going to recommend it in the letter however he was not going to discourage it either he figured it should be totally up to my family doctor i do not know if it is even worth it because i feel like it is gonna be the same bullshit all over again and i will probably leave with another prescription for antidepressants now that you know my story and i thank all of you who read it all or at least read enough to understand my situation do any of you have tips on how to get a benzo prescribed to you also are there any other young men out there who have struggled to get a benzo like me has anyone else noticed the sexism or is this just my own personal experience my counselor claims that you cannot just anticipate an anxious situation and pop an ativan and that it is only to stop an attack once it starts that does not really make sense to me and the people i know who have ativan say that they have taken it before job interviews before and it takes most if not all the edge off they also told me that it is bullshit when a doctor tells you that you cannot function properly on them because many people can apparently get away with a pretty low dose that gets rid of the anxiety without making you feel super sleepy and useless i understand you are not supposed to use a motorized vehicle even if you feel like you could do it the people i know who use ativan from time to time have taken it at work before and have been able to do their job just fine do any of you feel like you can take a benzo ahead of time when you know you are going into a situation that causes anxiety attacks and it works for you i do not get random anxiety attacks much anymore and even when they were frequent it was only like several times a month but now it is like once or twice a month at the most but i can often go months without them if i am put into certain situations that cause strong anxiety i can still have an attack though but most of my daily anxiety is manageable and i do not need pills for it i just want pills as a back up for those times i have attacks cuz they are fucking awful and i do not want to experience them anymore

as someone who has personally dealt with another person who has bpd i have a question the person i dealt with always lied to me about every freaking thing and whenever someone calls her out on her bullshit and confronts her when she is caught lying she flips it around and tries to make it sound like the other person is bad and as if she is the victim when she is not i know it is said that it is part of bpd but it just sounds like a psychologists passive response to a grade a asshole my best friends mom worked in a mental institute and told me she had gladly take 10 schitzophrenics over 1 person with bpd i have to say i agree with her the girl still comes into my workplace even though my husband and i have told her to stay away from me my managers are not consistent with telling eachother to keep her out and the police did not take her harassing me seriously because she is a female not a male double standard right if she were a he harassing me and getting her friends to do it for her then she would have been arrested she and her friends have been trying to find out my work schedule and finally found out when i work her best friend would come into the store without her and beg me to be friends with her it is creepy and sounds like she has a big lesbian crush on me which i do not doubt because she is sexually confused and has also made false rape reports on guys the problem is not as bad now as it used to be we act civil to one another when she comes in and i keep blocking all her extra facebook profiles i am like how many fucking e mails does this bitch have so nobody took it seriously not even the cops just me and my husband and my mom did i am looking for work somewhere else but i cannot switch just yet and almost everywhere is hiring only part time because the companies do not want to pay insurance so i am just staying there for the insurance at the moment so i guess my question here is why do they lie and act like victims when they are not saying it s just part of their bpd does not tell me much i guess i need a deeper explanation she is like an emotional vampire so i act like she does not bother me when she comes in but she does i want to have the upper hand on understanding her mentality i feel if i can do that i can control my emotions better i feel that despite how well i act she may still know how she makes me feel

first off i realise that some people who think that antidepressant are good might feel that this post would be harmful should anyone take it seriously but i believe that antidepressants are harmful and i have some experience with depression and antidepressants admittedly i am just one person and i am sure there are plenty of large scale scientific studies support ads but i want to share my personal experience my experience with depression has led me to believe that most of the time depression is causal from your situation rather than there being something wrong with your brain this is not just based on my own experience i think most people who suffer from depression do not openly talk about it not because they fear stigmatisation but because they do not want people s pity but when i started discussing ads with my friends i was so surprised how many people said oh yeah i was on those were you on ssris when i asked these people about it more it was almost always because of a break up or a bereavement or some other issue they had e g body image issues in my case it was a lack of agency when i left school and got a job my depression faded it is not gone it is a part of my personality but it does not ruin my life anymore it is now even perhaps a source of strength i feel like i have developed coping mechanisms that help me deal with shit that healthy people who have not been through the same hell lack i still have to stay on my toes but i do not embrace depression like i used to when i was severely depressed and i realised that drinking half a bottle of whiskey everyday was not a great idea i went to the doctor i got the 10 point questionnaire and was diagnosed and given a prescription within 15 minutes i took ads for a short amount of time some months i cannot remember exactly i will admit that i went into it incredibly skeptical and i was thinking about the placebo effect often now while i will admit that this skepticism could have caused a negative placebo effect what occurred to me was that all the side effects that the drugs had might be crucial to the placebo effect assuming with my skepticism that the drugs have no real therapeutic effect i have read that sugar pills that i really big or brightly coloured have a much greater placebo effect i think that the dry mouth low energy and lowered libido give the sufferer evidence that the pills are doing something even if the only real effects are negative i wanted to give the drugs a good shot despite my skepticism i was desperate so i stopped drinking when i started taking them this is something good that came out of it even though it did not help my depression but i think that i could or should have been able to give up drinking on my own or by some other method that was not potentially dangerous i still drink now but i do not have spirits in my house and i will sometimes go days without drinking that is the anecdotal part but i also have some philosophical insights something that kept running through my head when i was depressed was that i was broken i think that taking ads only goes to serve this cognitive misappropriation while medicalising something that is so painful and so all consuming is simple and comforting i do not think that it solves the problem and could even make it worse while there are definitely some medical conditions that cause depression as a symptom depression itself is not a disease in the same way that alcoholism is not a disease if you look at the amount of people who are diagnosed with depression i do not have the exact numbers on me but we both know that it is shitloads what are the chances that a figure like that is accurate and it is a figure that keeps rising even with the increased use of the drugs that are supposed to stop it if you are in that group consider the possibility that in this case the medical consensus might be wrong you are not broken now i know how palpable the pain and fear are when you are depressed but when you are cut it is not a disease but it really does hurt the pain is real and the pain of depression is just as real and perhaps worse but the source of the pain is a cause the cut might be from a thorn and the depression might be some trauma or some kind of affection you were deprived of but it will heal of course first you must remove the thorn and this is alot simpler in the physical world however if you agree with me that depression is causal and the cause is some shitty aspect of your life you do not necessarily have to take any actions at all i think that positive action is good but you can also change your perceptions of things with no effort whatsoever you can decide to stop being afraid or at least take the first step and decide that you do not want to be afraid anymore you can decide to get up and walk around the block just once you can decide to help someone when you recognise that your depression is causal and not because your brain is broken i think you will feel a significant sense of power over your destiny you will deal with the bereavement you will get over that break up and if you just have a shitty job then at least you know that the problem is that you need a more fulfilling job even if you cannot leave that job because of your responsibilities at least you know that there is not anything wrong with you anyone with your intellect would be depressed in that shitty job either change it or change your perception of it the challenge is identifying the cause which is not always apparent i do have some thoughts on why depression is getting more prevalent is today s civilised society but i realise that this is already way too much text and that few people will read it edit paragraphs
why i think antidepressants are bad
today i heard a woman was raped by a man in university of british columbia i wonder if she is a client of the mental health team will they tell her to compassion to him because he is sick tell her the world is not fair anyway tell her to forget about it tell her that she alone is responsible i do not know however the mental health team told me all when a woman has been harassing me

since the onset of my ptsd symptoms i have received many suggestions from doctors to try cbt if i hear one more person suggest cbt i am going to scream cognitive behavioral therapy is just one of many types of therapies it is based primarily on restructuring our thoughts and behaviors to make us feel better it is widely touted by doctors as being proven or evidence based this is primarily because it is one form of therapy that is easily measured this does not make it good some things are easy to measure like things that come in finite quantities and more abstract things like relationships are not so easily measured please understand that there is a major benefit to insurance companies for endorsing cbt because it is a short term therapy that can be delivered in a group cutting down on costs for them many doctors will recommend cbt even if it is not what is best for the client please do not do cbt just because it is the first thing offered if it is the type of therapy you want to do then by all means try it i did a cbt workbook years ago and i found it really helpful but if you want to do long term therapy or more in depth therapy or if you just want someone to listen to you without judging you do anther type of therapy get the type of therapy that is best for you and if your insurance does not cover it say something because you should not have to suffer just so they can save a buck
cbt is not for everyone

hi all i have a question about a past roommate close friend she recently was hospitalized for messing up her meds but another friend roommate found out that she intentionally tried to hurt herself which led to hospitalization she is doing much better now seeing counselors and neurologists to take care of herself and generally seems happier when we hang out and more at peace part of this is probably because she broke up with an ex apparently this ex threatened to have her committed when she started to break things off my friends and i all agree she is in a much better headspace right now from what we see and that his tactics seem downright abusive is this something we should really be worried about he keeps lingering around her facebook posts and all and i want to tell her to just cut him out of her life if he causes so much stress but could he really have her committed my friends and i can definitely testify to her being in a much more stable place now and she lives with 3 other roommates who can attest to that as well we are in the us for reference thanks for your thoughts and advice
question about a friend and her safety
i am currently 18 and i had quite a strange experience when i was 11 13 and i still do not know what it was so basically there was this period in which i had too many thoughts i remember standing in the bathroom for half an hour while the shower was running with a bunch of thoughts another characteristic was that i always had to finish it that is what was causing the delay it was very annoying i also have ocd btw so sometimes i couldnt start a new activity before finishing these thoughts i still have ocd but i dont have this thing of finishing the thoughts taking hours an abundance of thoughts so the thoughts they just kept coming i cant even describe it anymore i just remember not being ablet os leep because there were so many thoughts calling my mom during break because i couldnt stop thinking and it was distressing me i dont remember much except for fragments like me being in art class and asking my friends all these weird questions of life i remember they did not really understand me and i felt frustrated but it wasnt like oh whats life in the philosophical sense it was more like why the hell are we here i dont understand my consciousness how can you do these trivial tasks without having these thoughts what are you doing i thought they were the crazy ones i also remember having a very strange moment in which i felt like i had taken over the old me like i was a bad me i also had all these dreams about demons and woke up in fear once and i kept thinking i had a bad spirit in me it was very strange ok i still feel like i didnt describe the abundance of thoughts well its not like youre thinking a lot in yourself after a long day its like you cannot do anything else because they keep being there and also new ones keep popping up at every loose string so for example my thoughts would actually keep going off on a tangent in a way that just wouldnt happen now or for you guys like oh there was this book 10 mins of thinking about this one thing and then coming back to the main thought also another thing was that i had to recall exactly how i came on a certain thought another thing was that i was afraid that if i didnt have a certain thought do a certain thing it would change how events would be another thing was that i remember this before the storm broke out it was summer and i movd around the house while watching a show or something and i started telling myself i had to recall eexactly where i was in what order i was even asking my mother repeatedly where i was just before just to make sure that the order was correct it was very strange i think this is when it started since although i still have to perform rituals remember stuff daily this was much more obsessive it was all consuming literally i felt like that was my only goal to retreive those steps it was almost as if it was haunting me ok last but not least in that period ifelt disconnected form my parents i kept thinking why do i love them theyre just arbitrary people i also felt like nothing pleased me anymore even eating pasta or watching a movie or something everything felt goalless i kept on trying to find a goal i would eventually like or something to keep myself busy with explain why this was happening to me but i just couldnt and in that period i spoke to some friends again disconnected to reality i know this because i said some very very strange things i would never say now as you will see soon i said stuff like that i was having too much thoughts like i felt there was a demon in me a friend told me recently how much i had scared her this was years ago i wonder why she remember but whatevs i came up to her at the end of the day and said mary i havent given you a kiss this morning so give me a kiss we always kiss each other in the morning and she was really freaked out so basically this is just ocd right this had to be done and wasnt done for the day except i would never do something like this now ie trespass the boundary of involving other people in it and she said i looked absolutely crazy and not like myself ok i think i am done now i just want to know what was this btw there are some other important details i think i have left out but i have already written a lot for reference right now i am pretty normal ihave ocd still but others dont notice it i love my family well not rationally but i am not desensitized to them i still have pleasure i am going to study next year there was another period in my life around the time of earthquakes in japan that was also very strange and much scarier i actually think i may have mixed up some events but basically the too much thoughts thing is period i ok lol i sound crazy just tell me if you recognize anything i would be so glad if someone has had a similar experience btw i absolutely dont think i am schizophrenic or whatever i have never heard other voices or people inb4 you should not seek diagnosis on reddit i just want to hear some pointers experiences and i will in no way use this to diagnose myself i will probably visit a therapist about it soon
any idea on what this was too many thoughts desensitized to everything obsession with useless things
so i recently moved from texas to washington state i have ptsd i never had to register my dog as an esa whilst in texas because my landlord did not have any issues with her she does everything an esa does do accept i do not have her officially as one right now she is stuck in a humane society waiting for the word for me to have her transported but this landlord says that i cannot have her even as an esa and that the owners of the property will drop their insurance simply because years ago some guy was not paying attention to his akita and it bit a kids face off so the leasing company got sued is there a way i can fight to stay where i live and get my dog here any advice will be helpful i do not want to have to get another dog i miss my girl so much it is actually causing more stress
if my half pit bull halt black mouth cur is my registered esa can my landlord deny her living with me
about a year or so i worked at this call center it was a really crappy job basically to take calls from people enrolled in this benefits program that had all kinds of flaws that could not be fixed people would call in and be really nasty to you and you just had to sit there and take it there was this guy that worked there named jeff they had me sit with him for a couple weeks of training jeff seemed really normal he kept his cool with really annoying customers and made small talk with me about his girlfriend hobbies pretty regular stuff sometimes we would make fun of the customers in between calls but it was all in good fun anyways fast forward a few months and i am done training i still see jeff around the office we make polite small talk once in a while one day i am sitting there in between calls and i hear really loud obnoxious laughter i look over and it is jeff he is standing up at his cubicle laughing like a maniac everyone now is looking at him a supervisor went over and asked if he is ok and he just started laughing louder she started telling him to sit down and that he is disrupting everyone but her pleas were ignored he just kept laughing louder and louder finally security guards walked in and escorted him out of there nobody ever saw or heard from jeff again as far as i know anyhow i always suspected jeff had just had enough of his job and did not know any other way out i know he was not crazy who knows maybe his gf cheated on him or something like that and he lost it but it was just so out of character this guy was like the last person i would think would have a breakdown like this does anyone know what happens to people that do something like this do they go on some kind of government assistance i know in the old days they would throw you in a state hospital with the padded walls one more thing to add i do not think this guy drank or did drugs there was no reason to suspect that at least regardless of if he was faking i felt really sorry for him he was a pretty cool guy and this job fucking sucked hard so i could not really blame him if he was
have you ever thought someone was faking
i am a 19 year old male and for the past year or so i have gone through cycles of depression i feel that i most closely match the symptoms for manic depression or bipolar disorder as i go through periods of intense highs and lows right now i am in a very deep low and there is nothing that seems able to pull me from it i am thinking it would be a good idea to get on antidepressants to help level me out any advice edit i have never been on antidepressants or any mood changing drugs at least prescription mood changing drugs

how is trump affecting our emotional lives
i just left a psych ward a week ago i have been kept there for a month i am not going to disclose why i was there i am asking if i can sue the staff for how i was treated i was involuntarily committed and i had to sign paper work that would ensure my 72 hour surveillance and they would release me based on my behavior i was being non compliant only because i was treated poorly i was forced certain types of medication i was kept longer because i had a fight with the nurses at 3am they enforced curfew at 12am and i chose not to listen but that did not give the three women the right to pin me down i am a man but one of them was large and the other two were about my size i weigh 170 and lift and these women were not only rude but were surprisingly strong
vent i cannot get over being put down sedated at the hospital i cannot do anything about it
i have lived with my parents for practically my entire life and i am 28 i have developed an eating disorder that has crippled my ability to digest food i have experienced extreme desolation and loneliness for years and all the depression and anxiety that is been a part of it the thing is most of my trauma is non specific there are not really any specific events which it derives itself from it is more of a deep alienation from humanity over a long period of time i have had a little trouble with drugs with lsd and marijuana and i can definitely point to some of the bad experiences on both those drugs to affecting my mind states and i have had a couple experiences with other people that i might be able to say were traumatic but not in a really concrete or definite way what has been almost most traumatic is the reaction to the trauma my eating disorder was violent and pretty disgusting it involved lots of binge eating to the point of agony but never any vomiting the details are horrifying probably to most people that is not familiar with this kind of stuff and i am not going to go into them but i can say that this was also a kind of trauma because there is no traumatic event my life over the past seven years has been a blur splotched with nightmares i am not by nature a very apathetic person and i love laughing and enjoying life but i think a lot and a lot of the world really depresses me but i have essentially been depressed for all my adult life actually some of the most painful experiences i can remember are during my travels i have done some hitchhiking through the us and slept wherever i got dropped off some of the nights usually half sleepless were extremely painful and lonely hitchiking itself is a really painful experience to go through because the mass of cars that pass you by and the lack of humanity really got to me it has really scared me i am just trying to understand how this works in healing it because it is so vague and non specific i know that all i need is some love and to be able to share something with someone in a mutual way but i am not sure how to go about that i have had counseling before but i cannot afford an actual therapist and actually i am not very interested in one right now at least i just want to be able to start recognizing the symptoms of this trauma and how on a daily basis i can begin to work through it
i just realized i have experienced a fair amount of emotional trauma
so i have no idea how to help my girlfriend through this funk she is in she recently started a new job and was really enjoying it but one day made a couple of minor mistakes and could not handle it and had an anxiety attack she wound up heading to the er and getting a doctor s note that recommended taking a week off she is spent that entire week literally every waking moment on youtube looking up conspiracy theory videos and getting so into them that she now believes sandy hook was a government run farce and we are less than two years out from the next holocaust among many many other clearly mental theories it is painfully obvious to me that she is terrifying herself into psychosis the e r sent her to a gp who prescribed her welbutrin this was only a few days ago so i am hoping as she adjusts to that some of her positivity can come back i told her about 20 minutes ago that i was really getting concerned for her mental health saying that i was not going to argue with her views but that i believed even if we are headed to our doom she had regret not living a happy life while she had the chance she nodded and said i m past the point of being happy the most i can ever be again is content she went on to explain that when she was a child she had a constant feeling of some impending disaster and she now believes that it was divinely sent to her by god previous to this episode we were both agnostic she thinks god is telling her that we are going to be killed by the government and soon and if we do not prepare she started listing things like 432 gallons of water and 40 pounds of enriched pasta we will be dead within two years i have no idea how to bring back the positive sweet wonderful woman i fell in love with last september what can i possibly do i do not believe she is going to hurt herself but she has not said a single positive thing in a while and it is breaking my heart can anyone offer some advice

a few ways to boost your mood that have worked for me

perception it s not just black and white
bear with me it is 4 30 in the morning and i have got no clue how to accurately put this shit into words when i am not sleepy there is these two strange stimuli i get every now and then that just freak me out a little it is really hard to describe but it feels like some half remembered memory they are just random sensory bits that i will just suddenly feel every now and then it is weird though because i can imagine the sensations right now but that does not freak me out but rarely like once or twice a year something will trigger it in my mind and i will be able to recreate it in my mind much more vividly it just randomly hits me and i feel this weird sort of dread like i do not want to know where the hell this stimulus is from i apologize for how vague and weird this sounds i am at just as much of a loss as you commenters probably are but it has not hit me in like six months so i am not going to describe it exactly as it feels right so the sensations themselves there is two first one imagine a makeup removal sponge no seriously it is some object in that shape and size but thicker more cubic harder and more gummy like in how it looks that but with a strange smell like a plastic y smell when it hits me it just makes me nauseous one time during a bus ride it suddenly hit me and i felt like i was going to puke i asked the bus driver if i could open the window for fresh air and he would not let me i got through the drive just fine though it was still really weird i think what started it on the bus was part of my shoes i was sitting with one leg on my knee and part of that shoe was this opaque orange ish thing with a plastic y shoe smell second one this is less a physical object as far as i know and more of a movement i guess i really cannot describe this one accurately without having it hit me but basically try moving just your big toe and none of your other toes make the movement quick and snappy too if that is too difficult try your thumb but it is a lot shorter of a movement if that makes sense whatever it is it is about the size of my big toe but it feels like it is a quicker snappier movement as if what is being moved is shorter than the toe itself i am sorry i cannot really describe this one well has anyone heard of something like this before part of me wants to figure out what this is but there is always this weird sort of dread when it comes to these sensations like i do not want to know what it was are they some kind of repressed memories of some kind of traumatic event i cannot recall any major traumatic event i have had though so the fuck is it
weird vague half remembered stimuli that freaks me out what is it

breakthestigma
since i was a kid i often fantasise day dream that i have achieved everything in my profession or that i am a famous oscar winner or that i have won the booker prize or have become famous otherwise i know these to be fantasies day dream and often purposely enter them as i get a lot of pleasure is this normal i have been doing this since childhood
does anyone fantasise daydream that they are someone famous while knowing this to be a fantasy is this normal
i will try not to ramble on i am middle aged wheelchair bound with a laundry list of physical and mental problems due to a childhood filled with physical and mental abuse and years of hard living and hard drinking to try and forget i managed for years to keep myself together and became a successful executive in my chosen profession but ultimately crashed and burned from too much booze i ended up meeting a wonderful woman when at the end of my rope and she for reasons that will forever be a mystery to me saw something in me and convinced me to get help fast forward and after some initial problems and adjustments i was doing well on antidepressives and antipsychotics and life seemed better than ever now my wife has passed away due to a sudden illness and my daughter and son technically stepchildren but i never made the distinction moved back in to help out but the psychotic breaks panic attacks and sudden overwhelming feelings of helplessness are back i am wondering if my meds need to be changed or i am getting worse any thoughts will be read and appreciated

as someone with a history of mental illness it angers me to no end that the there exists legislature for my condition and only my condition that forces treatment on people like me if someone has kindey failure they can refuse dialysis effectively committing suicide and the court cannot order then to comply if someone is diagnosed with cancer they can refuse surgery and chemo sealing their and discuss that fully with their doctor what would happen and no one bats an eye but if i a mental health patient decide to discuss the option of suicide with my therapist or doctor i have to worry about being forced into court ordered treatment locked away in a hospital until someone who barely knows me thinks i am not going to harm myself where i lose basic human dignities and rights i lose the right to come and go bars are in all the windows like i am a criminal if i refuse to take my medication they can keep me there longer i cannot have shoes with laces i cannot choose when i eat or who sleeps in my bedroom why do some consider it noble to refuse treatment for physcial ailments but not mental ailments it is not a measure of support or will it is a measure of losing to a disease this week i will be making an advanced health care directive stating should i relaspe into severe mental illness again that i will forever retain my fundamental right as a human to refuse any an all treatment medical decisions should be based upon what the individual wants not whar a society deems to be best for the individual and what i want most is my dignity and autonomy i want should i lose this battle to be able to be around my loved ones and to get to say goodbye to everyone and where no one is afraid they will go to jail because they let me do it i wanr not hidden away in the dark alone if i lose i dont want someone to find my body i do not want anyone to ever wonder could i have done more i want to keep the same basic rights given to every person

i just got banned from a forum website for claiming that i ve been seeing a psychologist and for exhibiting mental issues this is by all means a voilation of humans right that is not only the right of speech but also the right as an individual who is been suffering in the dark i am abominated and distraught by the treatment received online tom s hardware is disgusting i did not in fact do anything that voilated their rules let alone using abusive language the closest that i have come to using profanity is the phrase screwed up it is also worth to note that i explicitly stated that i wrote this for peace of mind and recommendation from a psychologist which resulted in my ban the perceive this to be unacceptable for their standard in this sense their terms and conditions should be rescinded

i always knew something was wrong with her both my dad and i but never tried to seek some help i do not know why we always knew she was a dog that barks but never bites so we kind of coped with it but few days ago she said something that disturbed me i got you on this world and i can take you out of it i know i had never thought that way of her or anyone else in my family and i also know that that is not a way to treat a son does anyone have an advice about what should we do or what should we not do any advice is appreciated
my mother s weird statement
i mean i admire their compassion but why why is that when i feel absolutely rotten on the inside and absolutely dead moreover i feel actually i know that i am finding myself resentful of those who take responsibility for their actions and want a genuine change for their lives probably because this is the complete antithesis of my own character and have no desire to change to live and perhaps to flourish in life in fact it puts a smile on my face when i see unrepentant people including those who refuse to take responsibility it shows they have a flaw just like me people who are the opposite of this are a constant reminder of my fundamentally flawed character spirit psyche so having admitted that do i still deserve happiness

what it is like to be a mental health statistic in the church
as the subject says i cannot stop thinking from the moment i wake up to the moment i sleep i have incessant mind chatter and constantly creating a strategy for everything even when having casual conversations with people i have to think of the best way to say what i feel and the probable reaction to what i say for the first 7 years of my life as a child i had vivid nightmares almost every night i always had a wild imagination my thoughts often merge from one subject matter to the next and become more and more extreme and irrational i often hide my feelings from people and because of this i have been told i am a cold and detached person i ve always been a deep thinker since i was a child i have been told i have always been a bright and intelligent person but it seems like the down side of this is that i tend to analyze everything sometimes my brain just goes into overdrive mode and do stuff without thinking and while i am doing my daily activities i think of other complex things in my life this probably came from my aunt because she always told me to think carefully everytime i am talking or even doing something but my thinking always goes a drift to other topics some of my peers might say i am a genius but some might see me as retarded hmmmmmm i cant stand this thing anymore maybe i am adhd mmaybe going crazy

hey currently i am not doing any kind of sports or fitness i am not big or unsporting or anything really that would restrict me from something the thing is i am not very motivated to for example workout sometimes i am but that feeling fades in a matter of days previously i have played tennis and golf although i enjoyed both of those i had some issues tennis was actually pretty fun the only thing bugging me was that after some time there did not seem to be anything new to it it also did not help that i did not really like my coach and mates golf was also fun but it was not demanding enough physically mentally is a whole other story i also like to skate but since it gets really cold in winter i cannot really do that at the moment and i am also not that good at it i have researched a bit which sports i could play but i cannot seem to find one that really fascinates me or rather that i can fascinate myself to start doing if i think about what i really enjoy to do it would be sprinting i am quite quick but i do not have much endurance this is a bit information on my physique height 178cm weight 58kg age 16 not especially strong nor weak as i mentioned quick but on the cost of endurance i would be glad to give you more details if i missed something important and i do not know whether that makes a difference but i play piano so if you have any advice on which sport or activity would suit me please let me know i would really appreciate it thank you in advance
i need help finding a sport that suits me help would be much appreciated

i will admit first and foremost that baseball and football rank much higher in my book that basketball that being said i used to really enjoy watching nba and college basketball lately and tonight s game was no exception it gets harder and harder to watch the game has become entirely about fouls and officiating after every missed shot someone complains openly to a referee about getting fouled the refs have become so trigger happy that any type of contact gets called regardless of how hard of contact it was or if it actually hindered the shooter on top of that there are players dwyane wade is by far the worst that react after every shot whether it goes in or not like they got fouled there are times that i am convinced wade drives the lane and jumps in the air wildly without the intent of actually making a shot but rather getting to the line it just seems like the players would rather take a shot that is more likely to get a foul called than take a higher percentage shot

alex rodriguez jayson werth edit i am not really trying to beat up a rod enough people have done that already for years my major point is to highlight how amazing jayson werth s postseason and season have been in comparison this man deserves his due edit 2 ok originally i did not hate on a rod i was just trying to up the love for j werth but after hearing the ridiculous lovefest for a rod i am calling him out he is undoubtedly a great performer his statistics show this for years but he did at some point make the choice to use performance enhancing substances he constantly cheated on his wife he repeatedly was an ass to teams bailed on umiami at the last moment left the mariners just bc of outrageous sums of money and then demanded that the rangers trade him some people still value character and integrity in athletes and he is utterly lacking in these attributes
alex rodriguez overhyped full of steroids and paid 33 million is playing at the level he should be this playoffs jayson werth on the other hand is playing at the same amazing level but for only 2 5 million

so there i was getting ready to go out for my birthday and after smoking a bowl with 3 of my close friends we finish our drinks and head out by the time we get to our first stop i am feeling weird i thought maybe i had drank too much too fast the lack of sleep from the roadtrip the day before the good weed or a combination of the 3 we sit at the bar and then my reality quite literally shatters all of a sudden it is 3 hours later and we are at the bar i had booked my party at i was terrified at the sheer volume of people and had complete sensory overload i thought my nose was bleeding and that i was covered in blood i did not know where anyone was i did not know what was happening and thought i was going insane autopilot kicked into gear and i found myself at home in tears not knowing what to do i guess the experience in and of itself is not too pertinent but i feel very wronged and very hurt both friends knew i hated hallucinogens but i slipped me two tabs in my beer while i was getting ready i am having a hard time putting into words how i feel the total destruction of trust the inherent malice and ignorance behind it the callous cruelty behind doing that to someone especially a friend and what i did to deserve it for lack of a better term i feel like my mind has been raped my parents want me to press charges but i do not know what that will accomplish both friends along with the rest of our circle so how distraught and terrified i was and apologized profusely saying they had no idea i had react like that but at the same time how fucking stupid does someone have to be to dose their friend with high powered lsd and cut them loose in a 600 person club tl dr i had my self respect dignity trust in my friends and my birthday stolen from me after getting drugged against my will and knowledge by 2 close friends and now i am feeling very shattered ps this is not a pity plea i have never felt this violated before and i do not know what to do anyone else had this happen to them and how did you deal with it edit i have done boatloads of drugs before including acid and good things have never come from hallucinogens i cannot handle the head trip and succumb to sensory overload which is why i do not do them i told these two that i was not down and they dosed me anyway the breach of trust is huge i cannot look at them without feeling very upset and angry i got so fucking high that i could not even process basic questions i pretty much felt like frank from it is always sunny when he is trapped in the garbage can on acid but not funny at all i know they did not mean any harm but we have talked previously how shitty and deep it is to do that to someone it is a move one would pull on someone they really disliked i do not feel comfortable being around them even though they apparently meant well it is shitty because i cannot trust them to look out for me deep down i slept everything off but still feel fucked update doing shitty things in the past justifies having shitty things done to you hm you are right reddit i have not lead the most virtuous of lives that being said i did not need that to happen to me it seems a bunch of you are using the house story as your main argument against me let me clarify that situation i lived in the house everything was fine and i let a friend move in that started to destroy it i lasted 3 weeks before moving out and what they ended up doing to that house afterwards had nothing to do with me at the time of the posting i was simply watching them be idiots and thought it appropriate to post the story in that thread but apparently the powers of assumption have twisted that into my sole responsibility because i was the one that got handed the eviction notice even though i did not even live there at the time stick to the topic at hand i asked what the best course of action was if anyone else had gone through this kind of thing and how they handled it i did not ask for a character decoration because trust me i know i am not a shining example of a human being in fact i am painfully aware of it which is why getting dosed was so terrifying i have been a good friend to those dudes i was always there for them and bent over backwards when i could granted i am a sketchy dude but fucking with someone s mind for shits and giggles no matter how good the intention is a dangerous game and no one deserves it yes years ago i gave a friend a minor dose of mdma so he would get out of his shell and have fun for once instead of being cloistered and awkward that shit is not the same as lsd and those who know know that i am not saying it was the right thing to do in retrospect it was shitty but he did not have a meltdown i did not give him excessive amounts to fuck with him and everything turned out awesome because i stuck by his side and made sure nothing bad happened he also knows about what happened now and periodically indulges in m when he wants to party and while he wishes that i would have told him he does not hold it against me and said i should forgive the lads for their trespasses as it simply just was a fucking mistake that is entirely different than having one s vision suddenly fractal and not know why and having all one s demons rear their ugly heads over heavy bass yeah i do need to clean my life up i have been trying to which is why i moved out of the destroyed house in the first place while taking steps to get the fuck back to school i thought i had a better perception of my friend s characters and while they are deeply apologetic there will always be that thorn
my friends drugged me with acid on my birthday without telling me and i had a very public meltdown in the bar i am feeling very violated it was terrifying and i do not know what to do
i rent an apartment with a friend at night i can sometimes hear her breathing heavily and masturbating not through the room but the walls for some reason sound travels easily through these walls i noticed it when i lay in bed one night and leaned the side of my head to the wall making my ear sit right next to the wall she is kind of shy and reserved i of course have to masturbate as well when i hear her doing it since it is so incredibly hot what i have been thinking about is kind of just walking in on her with a bulging boner asking her if she needs help that or maybe just telling her how hot it is i do not know not sure what the results are going to be though edit i decided to walk in on her it went okay
i hear my house mate masturbating should i walk in on her

for everyone s sake replace anyone in the op title with everyone sorry guys i will not be replying to this post anymore if i see someone with an opinion i have not seen yet i will respond but i am starting to feel like a broken record and i have studying to do thanks major edit here s the deal i have no idea about how it feels to live in a society with guns being normal my apparent ignorance is probably due to the fact that surprise surprise i am in fact ignorant i did not post this to circlejerk i posted this because i did not understand i am seriously disappointed reddit i used to think you were open minded and could handle one person stating their opinion even if it was clearly an ignorant one next time you ask if we australians ride kangaroos to school i will respond with a hearty fuck you faggot you are an idiot rather than a friendly response treat others as you would have others treat you edit 1 i have made a huge mistake edit 2 here are a few of the reason s that have been posted that i found interesting no bans on guns have been put in place because they would not do anything if they were i disagree americans were allowed guns as per the second amendment so that they could protect themselves from the government lolwut all this achieves is make cops fear for their lives constantly its breaching on your freedom this is fair enough to some degree though hypocritical since why then do you not protest the fact that you cannot own nuclear weapons for instance edit 3 my favourite response so far i hope a nigger beats the shit out of you and robs you of all your money then you will wish you had a gun to protect you i would not wish i had a gun i would wish the dark skinned gentleman was not such an asshole edit 4 i must apologise to everyone who expected me to respond to them i have the day off tomorrow and i will respond to a few people but bear with me i have over 9000 comments to go through most of which are pretty damn abusive it seems i have hit a bit of a sore spot  edit 5 if there is one thing i will never forget from this conversation it is this i will feel much safer tucked up here in australia with all the spiders and a bunch of snakes than in america i give myself much higher chances of hiding from reddit s death threats here than hiding behind some ironsights in the us goodnight and see you in the morning some answers to common questions how do you ban guns without causing revolution you phase them out just like we have done in australia with cigarettes first you ban them from public places conceal and carry or whatever then you create a big gun tax then you stop them from being advertised in public then you crank out some very strict licensing laws to do with training then you are pretty much set only people with clean records a good reason and good training would be able to buy new ones they could be phased out over a period of 10 15 years without too much trouble imo i have just read some things about gun shows in america from replies in this thread i think they are actually the main problem as they seem to circumnavigate many laws about gun distribution perhaps enforcing proper laws at gun shows is the way to go then r circlejerk is that way i honestly did not mean to word the question so badly it was late i was tired i had a strong opinion on the matter i think its the its our right to own firearms argument which i like the least at this point also the self defence argument to a lesser degree but what about hunters i do not even slightly mind people who use guns for hunting or competition shooting while i do not hunt would not bolt action 22s suit most situations they are relatively safe in terms of people stopping power more likely to incapacitate than to kill why do you hate americans so well to start with i do not hate americans as for why am i so hostile when i respond its shit like this this is why i posted the original post let me preface this by saying i am ignorant of american society while i assumed that was obvious by my opening sentence apparently i was wrong i figured it was obvious to everyone that guns cause problems every time there has been a school shooting it would not have happened if guns did not exist therefore they cause problems i am not saying all guns cause problems and i am not saying guns are the only cause of those problems its just that to assume something like a gun is a saint and can only do good things i think that is unreasonable therefore i figured everyone thought guns cause at least minor problems what i wanted was people who were pro guns to explain why they were pro guns i did not know why people would be pro guns i thought that it was stupid to have so many guns in society hence i think that allowing everyone to own guns is stupid i wanted people to convince me i wanted to be proven wrong and i used provocative wording because i expected people to take actually take notice and speak up for their beliefs
i am an australian i think that allowing anyone to own guns is stupid reddit why do so many americans think otherwise
i talked about reddit being down and then gave some money to a global giving campaign help equip a rural kenyan library with a computer
we are back what did you do during the great outage of autumn 2012
i always thought i was a forever alone kind of guy even though i had been in love with this girl for like a year and a half in the friend zone of course her douchebag boyfriend dumped her in november and of course i was there to comfort her then i somehow convinced her to go out on a date with me things have been steadily progressing over the course of several weeks until nye when we had sex for the first time we have had sex a couple times since then and therein lies my problem her pussy smells like cool ranch doritos the first time i thought it was a one off but it is happened every time since then i know it sounds pretty implausible maybe even slightly humorous but it is a serious problem i want to give her my best but i just cannot because every time i catch a whiff i get distracted i am finally having sex with the girl i love and all i can think about is cool ranch doritos what do i do edit please do not put this on the front page she is a redditor and she had kill me if she knows i posted this
problem with new girlfriend reddit please help me
tl dr of the comments redditors once again blame rich people for all the worlds problems
even after all the tax breaks the top 5 of earners in this country pay 58 of all taxes in america while the bottom 50 pay less than 2 of all taxes how is making the rich pay more justifiable when they already pay almost all of the taxes
i do not understand why my being a believer instantly makes me a bad person or ignorant or gullible etc but on reddit that seems to be the idea of the vocal majority do i understand there are some ridiculous things that religion asks me to believe yes do i believe everything i am told absolutely not blind faith is dangerous am i a man of science you betcha can i reconcile those seemingly contrasting beliefs i do evolution check big bang most probable young earth creation hahahaha not in a million years i know there are people like me and i know there are many non believers that are good and intelligent people and there are douchey believers and non believers alike i also know i am not perfect i think mormons were hoodwinked by smith and scientology is a quack slightly hypocritical i know but i have no issues with agnostics or jews or muslims or buddhists they believe what they believe and we are cool i find atheists edit gnostic atheists amusing since it takes the same amount of belief to say god does not exist as it takes to say he does but i do not hate those different from me i do not mercilessly mock them for being different at most i might shake my head and walk away or if pushed maybe we progress to a reasonable debate but i honestly want to know reddit why cannot we be friends disclaimer raised protestant have attended catholic mass frequently throughout my life and fairly progressive on social issues i do not attend church regularly and i am not entirely fond of organized religion religion should be there to help people discover their own truths i am an engineer well read and have a general understanding of non christian religions i know everyone is not like i described above but it does seem to be the prevalent school of thought thanks for reading this far tl dr why does reddit hate religious people edit i enjoy the debate and reasoning that is going on here guys it is refreshing hell i even enjoy some of the name calling at least to the ability to quietly chuckle at it i want you to know that i will read through all of this though it may take me some time i am taking the things you say and thinking them over i am reading the links you are posting i may even read dawkins if given the time please continue posting for i truly am glad to be able to read through this
reddit why do you hate me for believing in god

i introduced reddit to my girlfriend she loves it i want to surprise her when we get home tonight and reddit together
i am a girl that is a junior in high school and i have been bullied by other kids pretty much my whole life i read things online about atheist students being bullied and i do not doubt it but honestly i have never seen it most of the kids i go to school with are athiests some go to church because their parents force them to but they do not actually believe in god let alone christianity that is all well and good because we should all be free to worship or not worship according to our own values and beliefs but i am tired of being bullied by athiests at lunch i sit alone i do not have any friends and say a prayer before eating everyday i do not say anything out loud i just put my hands together and thank christ with my thoughts the other day this guy who is an athiest actually came over and pushed my tray to the floor and said tell your god to clean that up and all of his friends laughed i go through this kind of thing every day when i am on the bus i will read my bible and mind my own business and other kids will throw things at the back of my head call me jesus freak etc i tried to make friends but everyone hates me because i am not ashamed of my faith i do not bother anyone and i believe people should have the right to do as they wish as long as they are not interferring with anyone else s rights gay guys have bullied me too calling me hitler and all sorts of hateful things just because i read my bible what they never bothered to find out about me is that i actually support gay marriage i personally do not agree with homosexuality but i believe this is a free country and that religion should not have anything to do with the law i am overall a peaceful person what can i do to make everyone stop hating me i will not give up my religion or prayer edit someone in this thread asked me to describe a typical time i have been bullied and i said the following i am posting it here in case anyone else would like to know in the original post when i talked about the guy that knocked over my tray and said what he did while his friends laughed i did not say anything i just picked up my tray cleaned the food up from the table and went to the bathroom and cried in the stall the other day in class the teacher left for a meeting or something and a guy hit me on the back of the head with a book really hard and said that he is going to torture me until i stop acting like a jesus freak my entire face was red and most of the other kids just laughed although a few of them looked concerned and told him that he went too far the teacher never found out i never say anything about my religion so it is not like i am trying to force my opinions on them i am just tired of them hating me and treating me this way because i am not an atheist edit 2 thanks so much to those of you who care and are giving me advice no matter what you label yourself as you are good people and i am happy to have come across you
i am in a very awkward position and i know most redditors will hate me for existing let alone saying this but i am being bullied at school because i am a christian what can i do to cope with this
hi reddit my wife was an avid redditor for what i believe to be at least a good four years maybe a little more or less i do not think she ever made an account but i do not know for sure there was nothing signed in and nothing in the browser s history so yeah i m uh not exactly even sure why i am posting this maybe it is because she was so avid about this site that i feel like i should tell you what happened i do not want to talk too much about this but i will get it all out in one post just one then i leave i was diagnosed with cancer at the age of thirteen my twenty fourth birthday was two days ago my wife was diagnosed with cancer last year she died two days ago it s hard to think that i have survived quite this long while she was not even given that much of a chance but regardless the fact of the matter is that i need to talk to someone i can t though all of the people who knew us are too distraught over her death she was the social expert i handed all the backstage stuff so to speak and no one can offer a shoulder for me her husband well widow now it is hard reddit i cannot think about anything except her everywhere i look i see things that remind me of her i need to talk to someone but i can t so i am going to say it all here i gave her that cancer reddit i do not know how but i know that i had to have there is no reason for her to have spontaneously gotten cancer last year and me miraculously start getting better at the same time this is all my fault i do not want to kill myself but i feel like i owe her my life this is not fair reddit i need help i said i am only posting once and i am but i will read the comments i might reply to them that does not count as posting right i do not think so what should i do reddit
just one post then i go

redditors that were deaf but can now hear what language did you think in and do you think in your verbal language today

ladies what non sexual thing can make you want to bang a guy

happy yam day here is an album of yam memes to celebrate
i am glad people are giving money to good causes but i am beginning to think that the whole upvote and ill donate trend is just a bunch of lonely people trying to seek validation through karma if you have the money donate what you can and stfu about it edit let me clarify i think that charity should come from the heart with nothing expected in return yes karma is free and it does not hurt anyone to give out copious amounts of it however i feel like this whole trend belittles the entire idea of charity by turning it into some silly little game there is such thing as doing the right thing for the wrong reason and to address the whole it brings awareness argument it brings awareness to what how awesome r atheism is or that it is possible to donate to charity wow i never knew it gets people involved involved in what clicking an arrow if you want to get involved there are better ways what have you donated op complete non sequitur this whole thing reminds me of the rich guy who donates to an institution to get his name on the building as advertising for his business i am happy to see money go to these charity s but this whole fad is completely unnecessary
why let the number of upvotes determine the amount of money you donate to charity why not just donate what you can instead of whoring imaginary internet points
a family member posted this on facebook earlier and it made me wonder i know it is just a light hearted fb post but if i posted that women should be barefoot and making me sandwiches all day i had probably receive a lot of flak is it because historically women have been treated unfairly so now they can get away with this in my opinion this type of mentality is a real problem nowadays and making light of it makes things worse if your relationship truly feels this way you are both doing something wrong
why is it considered ok for women to perpetuate the the wife is always right the husband is always wrong mentality so openly and publicly while male chauvinism is considered despicable disgusting
i have absolutely nothing against homosexuals i have gay friends and family believe homosexuals should be able to marry and do not harbor any ill will toward people who are homosexual however i do not understand why it is or can be considered normal or not an illness the natural state of human must be heterosexual as it enables reproduction our only purpose pretty much everything that we are and how our bodies are designed is for eating and intercourse propogation of the species as it is for all species if it is not a choice if it is predetermined how is that not a mental disorder how is it normal if you buck the design and purpose of your existence again i mean no disrespect and i am sorry if i offended anyone i just do not understand and i want to
i mean no disrespect but can someone explain to me why how being homosexual is not an illness
she left me for a different guy i do not feel i did anything wrong edit i was hoping for more funny stories but ok edit no i dont care about fake internet points she was doing something stupid she thought would annoy me i was hoping you would all have some similar petty stories of spite
my ex is using multiple accounts to downvote my posts after a bitter breakup what spiteful crap have people pulled on you lately
today she texted me essentially saying that i am obligated to her not to spread this because it is no one else business i see what she is saying but at the same time i would not feel right lying to people who care enough to ask me why i broke up with her for the sake of protecting her after what she did repeatedly so what i am asking is whether honest as the moral thing is the right path or telling a small lie for the sake of her happiness is right thanks
my girlfriend cheated on me and when people ask why i broke up with her i tell them is that wrong vindictive of me
because the new queue is becoming overwhelmed with nearly identical questions about your experiences with september 11 2001 a megathread looks necessary pretty much all 9 11 posts should go here for the time being if you have a question as to whether yours is unique enough to warrant its own post check with the mods consider each top level comment a new thread to ask a question respond to that comment as you would respond to it if it were a thread  it is tagged as serious non serious offensive or otherwise inappropriate content will be removed
serious 9 11 megathread where were you how has it affected you other questions
obviously coming from someone who never has had this happen b4
what does it feel like to get a post on the front page

girls of reddit what are signs that you give off to let a guy know that you are interested
france for me because i have been there a few times and every time i have found the french to be loud and rather annoying that and i do not like wine cheese or most things that come out of france
you are allowed to remove one country from existence without consequence which one would you pick and what is your reason
i read it here after reading it on another reddit and i was thoroughly depressed i always believed in non violence and often told people think of gandhi but this disgusts me and it is not just this site
til gandhi regularly beat his wife and kids his son converted to islam he had a friend in hitler and told the jews to commit a mass suicide what have you learned about a revered leader that blew your mind

a huge black at t pop up keeps on appearing on reddit blocking my view of reddity stuff that is not cool edit this issue has of course been fixed much thanks to the staff of reddit for their extremely quick response d
dear reddit whats with the ads
i have seen a lot of potentially great conversations die off here simply because the initial discussants do not bother to vote it up i guess it might be because they do not want to give people karma but if you enjoyed something enough to comment or even just found it provoking why not give others the same chance just a thought i really like this sub and just thought i had see what people think about this
why do people answer questions in an askreddit thread but not upvote it
methinks all these newbies are a little too enthusiastic and not cynical and bitter like the rest of us
has anyone noticed there are a shit ton of upvotes going around
i do not get it it seems like child exploitation should be the one thing we all agree is wrong now there is a preteen girls subreddit if you look up the definition of child pornography the stuff in this subreddit clearly and unequivocally fits the definition and the free speech argument is completely ridiculous because this is a privately owned website so recently a thread in r wtf r wtf discussed this subreddit and i am completely dumbfounded at how many upvotes were given to people defending that cp subreddit so my main question is what the fuck is it about child pornography that redditors feel so compelled to defend i know different people have different limits on what they consider offensive but come on child pornography it is bad people why the fuck are not the reddit admins shutting down the child exploitation subreddits and i am not interested in any slippery slope arguments first they shut down the cp subreddits then the next step is nazi germany v2 0 edit i just do not understand why there is such frothing at the mouth defense when it comes to cp of all things for the pics of dead babies or beatingwomen subs you hear muted agreement like yeah those are pretty fucked up but when it comes to cp you will hear bombastic exhortations about free speech and voltaire and how nazi germany is the next logical step after you shut down a subreddit edit to all of you free speech whiteknights have you visited that preteen girls subreddit it is a place for people to jack off to extremely underage girls if you are ok with that then so be it i personally think kids should be defended not jacked off to i make no apologies for my views on this matter
why do the reddit admins allow child exploitation subreddits and why do so many redditors defend them under the guise of free speech
most of the posts on r christianity are about philosophy how to deal with life s problems intellectual discussions and supporting one another most of the posts on r atheism are about mocking belittling or otherwise bashing those that do not agree with their outlook on life yet the posts on reddit usually follow the narrative that christians are hateful bigots who exclude atheists while atheists are intellectually superior why is reddit like this
why is reddit like this

former trump supporters of reddit what was the final straw for you
this question is directed to the redditors who are posting pictures of their patients who tried to commit suicide this is a very serious matter and i want to know what is wrong with you i first noticed this on the front page of reddit i left a comment which i will quote below i am sorry but you are a complete asshole for posting this online think for a second picture you are this guy if you just tried to commit suicide by shooting yourself in the head with a nail gun would you really want your doctor or whatever the hell you are posting a picture of it online no you wouldn t i highly doubt he gave you permission to post this online nor did you probably have the balls to ask someone who just tried to kill themselves if you could share it online i know it shows no info about the patient but still it is not appropriate and if your boss found it i guarantee you would be fired on the spot i hate to be the one to say it i am sure almost everyone reading this will disagree with me and down vote this comment but at least i have the balls to say something permalink to my just a few minutes later i scrolled through the comments and noticed someone else commented on the post saying i had a patient try a similar with a link to a pic of the patients injuries it is not funny and i want to know why you think you have the right to share pictures of patients who tried to kill themselves if you are one who did this i want you to read my quote above and think it over i know i sound like a dick but i just want to know why people are doing this it is so disrepectful it is not even funny maybe i just see it this way being that i was in volunteer ems for a few years and now am a volunteer firefighter in training maybe it is just the way i view things being that there are hippa laws and crap but still really edit 1 for the people saying it s an x ray no one will know who it is anyway that is not my point my point is it is completely inappropriate to be posting this kind of content online for the world to see being that these people are doctors or whatever they claim to be it is inappropriate period edit 2 for the people saying it is not illegal it might be illegal it might not be either way i did not say anything about that i said it is inappropriate not it is illegal edit 3 i am not offended i am just stating i think it is wrong whether the doctor posted this or the nurse sent a friend a pic this and the friend posted it both the nurse was wrong for sharing confidential things like this as well as the friend for posting it online as far as the ems fire dept shit goes and my age fuck off you know nothing about how it is where i volunteer you have to be 16 to be a dispatcher 18 to be a medic emt and 18 to be a firefighter i have been volunteering for a few years starting by cleaning around the ems base cleaning the rigs filling the soda machines taking out trash etc worked my way up to dispatch about a year or 2 before i was 16 and have been doing it since you do not know what it is like so shut up maybe my family has been involved for years maybe not you do not know the deal so keep your mouth shut about it it is volunteer they can do what they want do not call it bullshit i take time out of my life to volunteer to save lives fuck off and stop going off topic edit 4 here s a similar example let us say some hacker gets into your computer and sets up a key logger he get s all of your passwords and leaks them to the world on reddit or some other website would you want the world seeing your personal passwords that go to your bank accounts emails etc no it is personal privacy you do not want your personal stuff being shared with the world neither does this guy who tried to kill himself my point is it is not right i am sure you wouldent want it happening either i am looking for reddit s opinions not trolls to starts fights and shit it comments go away if you are looking for trouble edit 5 most people disagree yet some agree those that agree have mostly shared valid points that i may not have said so thank you i have gone into the negatives for down votes but it was worth it i wanted to speak my mind
what is wrong with some of you redditors totally inappropriate

yam what is you favorite movie about if a word of the title is replaced with yam
i could not care less about american health care politics celebrities corruption which covers about 95 of the stories on reddit who is with me edit 1 unless your website filters the entire world out its not an american website 2 i like americans i have some great american friends i just do not give a crap about the current political news 3 i love reddit but in the last year or so i have found it a lot more difficult to find content that i am interested in when i first started it was easy i ignored it during the presidential campaign fair enough guys but now its just annoying 4 i also prefixed my question with wouldn t it be great not aren t americans all assholes if i unsubscribe from say politics would not i miss some interesting australian political stories would i need a subreddit au politics unless it was cross posted to australia then would not we need a subreddit for every country that had politics the question i asked i think was a valid one politics should contain all political stories but it would be nice to filter certain topics or countries of origin thanks to everyone who gave actual suggestions p s australia has free healthcare has already seemingly recovered from the financial crisis that apparently originated in america has lobsters the size of your average dog
would not it be great if there was a way to turn off all america related posts in reddit

reddit i love you but i do not get it all of the troll face fuuuuuu me gusta challenge accepted etc stuff is just lame what is the obsession
i just learned i was dying reddit i am 22 and i have no idea how to tell my fiance gf of 8 years about it or my family long story short i broke my neck when i was 9 when i was tackled into a tree at school and severed my c 1 c 2 vertabra in my neck when it broke it sheered an artery in my neck and i had a stroke when part of my cartridge dissected an artery which paralyzed me for two years i had 2 surgeries for that but recently found out the clot is growing and i will go brain dead in the next decade edit i am gonna tell her and my family its not gonna be easy but i am gonna try what do i do ask me anything or offer advice i will be up till the alcohol knocks me out
how do i tell my love ones i am dying
when people have a legal problem everyone tells them to lawyer up but when people have a psychological problem suddenly everyone tells them to get on medication and spend thousands of dollars on expensive therapy instead of simply going to a doctor i have even seen people recommend over the counter medication why what is the difference why not simply tell them to talk to a psychologist guess what you are not a trained professional and even if you were you would not give a diagnostic based on ten lines of text without ever meeting the person in the first place you have got a legal problem you talk to a lawyer you have got a health problem you talk to a doctor more often than not it is a minor problem stress due to exams feeling down due to the season etc what you are doing is borderline dangerous what if a person becomes so convinced she or he has depression that he read up on it and then simulate more symptoms he would no problem tricking a doctor into believing he is really depressed although he might not be in the first place worse the person not willing to talk about it in real life might order some crap on the internet and get serious sick medications are not bad but very few are without consequences sleep problem mood problems allergic reactions it is pointless to take medication if you do not really need it you are not a health expert nor do you have the experience to tell people to take medication your own personal experience is pointless stop trying to play the messiah and let people get help from a real life source thank you a real life psychologist edit yay downvoted i guess reddit likes to keep writing false advices on psychological help threads just do not cry when a person that follows your advice ends up killing himself or maybe that is what you want in the first place
reddit stop trying to play the expert it is dangerous
although it may be in the form of a question it may not be the best subreddit to get information from askreddit is more suited for questions to and about the people in the community not about news and current events

it just feels like everyone s forgotten about it and i do not ever remember hearing about anything they have accomplished i agreed with the message but i do not think anything will be accomplished by camping out in parks and yelling with megaphones

it seems like there was a time where reddit felt like a community for the past few years i have noticed a steady decline to the point where i am ready to leave anything i post immediately gets knocked down and mocked i know we are all wise asses but it is gotten out of control it is just plain mean at this point now before you immediately downvote this and leave a nasty comment think about what i have said
why is everyone a dick on reddit
just curious because i get really infuriated with a lot of people opinions liberal softie hippyesque on reddit even just reading through comments my bane is that i like to kill time looking at dumb useless shit and the occasional semi interesting article
how many of you are here just because you like to look at stupid shit and kill time even though you really hate the mindset of most of reddit
for every cheating girlfriend there is a cheating boyfriend in the world all i see is hate directed towards women here and it has begun to irk me edit2 yes it comes above edit1 say something nice about a woman you know or a generalisation edit1 let us say nice things about men too and not bash them women have a deep sense of loyalty when it comes to to their friends if anyone speaks out or hurts someone they love they will stand up for them men can be like that too men even though feminists will disagree have a need to protect whether it is women puppies or their friends they are also just have better depth perception edit 3 it is not the misogynistic jokes that irk me
why oh why does reddit hate women can someone say something nice about women

the answer is advertising imo i just want people to realize how victim they are to advertising as the hypocrisy has been driving me crazy of late edit1 and so this does not turn into r pcissomuchbetteryoudumbasscirclejerk and r macsrockmysockscirlcejerk conflict i would like to also like to mention how netflix right now is my only hope to stop paying 45 dollars a month for cable and 9 50 for a single movie ticket which is also driving me a bit crazy edit2 just got out a no computer class and went to check on this and it seems to have taken off a bit i am in awe and truly thank you for helping me come to a more educated opinion on the matter as it has shifted some in what i have read so far i am going to attempt to read everyone s comment because you took time writing it and it deserves respect however i do not have time to respond as i have a paper due tonight need to play starcaft which note runs like a 3 legged brontosaurus on a mac compared to a pc edit3 ok there is a lot about comparing products and how the two products are not the same thing and not comparable they are not the same thing right but they are both consumer goods why does mac get to be an inelastic good but netflix and elastic good as far as i see it mac should be inelastic because they do not really do anything that you cannot make your pc do it is just advertising that makes you feel as if they do things that other computers cannot do and is essential for survival in today s world edit4 my bf just looked at this and sighed heavily so those who came here to sigh at me for provoking reddit it is been done for you
why is the 7 dollar increase with netflix reason for pitchforks and cries of enough you greedy capitalist while apple is praised for charging 200 300 dollars more for a product you can get cheaper anywhere else
ok before you downvote me into oblivion at least hear me out i am not a vegetarian or into bestiality but i read a news article about a guy who had sex with one of his cows and he was sent to prison and all his animals were taken away from him under the guise of animal cruelty i found it kind of hypocritical that if he had shot the cow in the head with a bolt gun skinned it cut out its internal organs and ate them no one would even bat an eyelid he could have used a giant rubber dick to forcibly impregnate it so it would lactate and then kill its child to make veil veal and this would not be considered cruelty yet an act that cause neither the animal nor human harm is a felony seems kind of hypocritical in my opinion thoughts
why is it okay to kill a cow but the second you have sex with it it is animal cruelty please read before you downvote

forgive my lack of delicacy but why do white people so often fail to display a sociological imagination mistake anecdotal stories as a systemic reality and fail to recognize the impact of privilege
so basically i just came back from a different country in which i had 3 different girlfriends over the last two years the first of them apparently gave me asymptomatic hpv without me knowing which i then passed on to the second one whom i met a year ago i stayed with her for about 6 months during which we never used condoms because i had been checked for common std s but not hpv and she was on the pill stupidly i thought it was okay now 6 months after we broke up she has developed cervical cancer and according to the doctor she will die within a year without treatment the problem is she cannot afford it she has already had lots of treatment borrowed huge amounts of money from her friends and is in the process of selling her beauty clinic to pay back those loans now it turns out the disease is even more serious than she thought she has no health insurance and her country has zero state aid her family is really poor and she also refuses to tell them about her disease since she has found out the degree of seriousness she has basically accepted her own death she is only 25 years old really hard working beautiful smart and nice she worked from total poverty into having her own business with several employees rather than rely on her looks to get on the hook with some rich man if anyone deserves to die it is not her but she will simply not be able to pay the insane bills for cervical surgery and treatment no matter what she does she cannot get through this alone unfortunately she is not very well connected either being rather antisocial and preferring to just work and stay at home even though we just dated for 6 months i am one of the people who knows her best but currently in a different country i brought this upon her but i am 100 broke myself being a uni student yet i feel i am the only one that both can and want to help her my only option is to take out a huge loan and then send to her i have a line of credit of about 10000 i can use but i do not think that will be enough i am not sure how much money is needed but i am sure it is a lot and it will be over a long time it will be something that i would have to pay back on for the rest of my life but on the other hand if she dies and i did not help her i think i will never be able to live with myself since i was not only responsible for what killed her i was also the only one who could have helped her i found out about her cancer about 2 months ago and just today found out how serious it is i have just been crying all day and i am completely lost on what i should do please give some advice sorry if this is the wrong subreddit i will post this somewhere else if someone can point me to a more fitting one

edit people i am not looking for geniuses in this thread and i am not looking for super achievers i am well aware that high iq does not equal happiness and all of this i am simply interested in the everyday life of very intelligent people i think everyone will agree that 150 is quite above the average and enough to be anything you want in life it does not matter if they dig ditches or build nasa robots for a living i do not give a fuck edit2 til half reddit are semi geniuses

i am genuinely interested in the mindset on this it is not just a jab at americans you see a lot of people mention things wrong or right with their country on reddit without mentioning where they are from or saying the world when people from other countries know it is not true where they come from what is it about america that makes them assume they are the default country edit 1 a lot of great answers but my question can easily refer beyond reddit the world series for example where only americans play and i have seen tv shows where people insist theirs is the biggest best most important in the world when what they really mean is in the usa geographical isolation is the answer i never thought about but makes most sense so thanks to those that brought that point forward edit 2 i did not expect this to get so big and i thank a lot of the users for being serious with the question and answering it honestly i now see from a different perspective the size and scope of america the isolation from cultures as compared to europeans and other things for the other people ignoring the serious tag time to grow up
serious why do americans often talk like they are the default country
i am not trying to be dramatic about it but i just feel out of place anymore every thread seems to be dominated by puns these days and they are usually not even clever almost any link i post is immediately downvoted i could post that i found a cure for cancer and it would get downvoted into oblivion it just seems like the place is dominated by middle school trolls and it is really lost its appeal to me i can deal with differing opinions but i just cannot take all the childish bullshit so my question is are there any alternatives i have been coming here for years so the withdrawals would be pretty severe i feel like a heroin addict that wants to quit but would need methadone to do it edit two downvotes in 6 minutes this is precisely what i am talking about i am asking an honest question nothing offensive or rude in the slightest and i get downvoted sad edit 2 came back to a ton of comments i really do appreciate the input it is been pointed out that i have not really been adding much myself and it is a valid point i have just kind of been in frustrated asshole mode lately that is something i need to work on i was not always like that anyway i am going to check out some of the links you guys provided tis much appreciated edit 3 i just noticed i now have reddit gold if someone here got it for me thanks edit 4 so as this whole thing fades into the sunset i had like to say a couple things a all the naysayers that pointed out my post record are valid without even realizing it i have become part of the problem secondly a lot of good folk have come out of the woodwork i had like to again thank whoever got me the reddit gold and d i am probably not going to leave i was just being dramatic because i had just woke up silly me i did not realize what it had turn in to i appreciate all the comments and i thank you all for them it is honestly renewed my faith in this community so anyway i wish all that read this a good day or night or morning or whatever it may be there no hard feelings
serious question are there any good alternatives to reddit i just do not feel like i fit in anymore

expecting down votes to hell and back here but almost every aspect of religion which i do not like such as the zealous preaching the high and mighty social stances the we re right no matter what you say attitude and the general in your face everywhere you go ness of it seems to have crept in to atheism of late to the point that i now find it quite hard to distinguish and really do not see the point many people have been turned off from religion because of these factors yet they seem to be creeping in to atheism or perhaps even rife so what do we who do not want to be associated with that side of things regardless of whether we believe in creation or evolution or both now call ourselves edit i do not think i have ever seen a thread so evenly split all the way through it is had almost equal up and down votes
is it just me or is atheism becoming a religion

an odd way to celebrate but the timing was coincidental enough we decided to make the most of it in our subreddit r ideasforaskreddit the moderators take suggestions from the community about what the users would like to see from this subreddit recently this post asking for one week free of sex became wildly popular the most successful suggestion in r ideasforaskreddit so far so by popular demand r askreddit will begin a one week trial of not allowing any questions about sexual topics this trial will begin today the 27th of january and will run for approximately one week the range of sexual topics that will be removed covers porn recommendation posts nsfw or disgusting image posts personal sexual questions and everything in between these questions will be automatically removed by the automoderator based on a number of keywords and redirected to r askredditafterdark the nsfw version of r askreddit but the automoderator is not flawless so if you see a post that you think violates the rule please report the offending post with the week drawing to a close we invite you to share your reflections of it with this in our subreddit r ideasforaskreddit thank you also remember no personal information the sticky may be gone but the rule is not

had an elderly lady recently ask me how much her son s cherry 1963 corvette was worth it was driven only 1000 miles before he went to vietnam and died in the battles she thought it was worth maybe 1500 or 2000 i told her it was much more valuable than that and that she should call a dealer to sell it she did and received a very substantial amount of money in the neighborhood of 70 000 she came to my home and offered me a check for 50 000 i told her there was no way i could take her money it was her s and she should use it to do something to honor her son or something she wanted to do did i do the correct thing was i a fool i know this was something that i had to do i would never have been able to sleep at night had i taken her money but i also could have used it however it was not my car nor my family no way i could have taken the check fool or not

last night i was at an admittedly nice wedding the groom told me that in total the wedding cost over 60 000 now they are both physicians but even 8 years after graduating both are still paying off med school bills they had to finance part of their wedding with credit cards even with their combined income i see spending this much for one day a total waste i asked why the hell he would spend so much and he gave me the answer i usually hear she always wanted a big wedding  most people getting married are just starting out saddling yourself with a huge amount of debt is just stupid stupid stupid edit the groom himself told me he cannot afford this wedding and worried about all the extra shifts they are going to have to do just to pay for it over a year s worth of shifts just to make the costs fit into their already tight budget that is just a stupid way to start off a marriage and financially irresponsible edit since i have the luxury and attention of the front page i will yield some true and apparently unpopular advice it is your wedding day yes it deserves to be special however do not allow it to become a burden on the bigger picture your life together couples fighting about money working extra shifts to get things paid just to pay debt while not spending time together hurts relationships if you are young and just starting out please delay gratification save some money for your own future and dare i say for your future children s future you can buy a car and even a house outright in cash it takes resolve and sacrifice but you can do it to the few who heed this advice good for you i wish all of you getting married the best and hope you all get off to a good start keeping it real redditluv

this is my best guess as to where to put this so if i should go elsewhere just let me know i am 18m a soccer fanatic and i have played since i was 4 years old i have always been very careful to take care of my legs they are very powerful relative to the rest of my body can squat 300lbs but weigh only 135lbs and are very agile i take pride in my legs this may be weird but i do whenever my legs become even slightly entrapped such as getting tangled in the straps on a backpack under my desk wrapped up in the sheets of my bed or even cramp in an area with little leg room such as a small desk or car i begin to feel panicked and nauseous any time that my legs begin to feel restricted it automatically makes the rest of me feel restricted and i feel awful would this be considered claustrophobia cleithrophobia or am i just overreacting
mild cleithrophobia possible

child anxiety panic attacks
this is my first time posting anything so thankful i found this thought i had say something about 2 years ago i started having major problems major panic attacks out of nowhere fine one moment utter terror and pain the next the worst of it would last several hours but even when the worst passed i could not find even the slightest bit of happiness for up to a month it really took a lot out of me little background i am a recovering alcolohic beyond that no major trauma or troubles in life i asked for help pretty much immediately i see a therapist regularly i have seen another therapist and i have discussed it with my primary care i have discussed with a lot of guys from aa most people do not seem to understand at all my wife thinks i am crazy and weak i have felt pretty much alone with this i have felt pretty good lately therapy has helped i think i have found the right meds low dose of zoloft but the darkness of it is always hovering it always seems to come out of nowhere being somewhere far from home will push me over the edge or other situations from which i cannot immediately extract myself sometimes thoughts of bad things i have done in the past nothing too bad trigger an overwhelming desire to confess i cannot take xanax or ativan because it makes me think i am going to die i take cholesterol medication and have to examine each pill before taking it to make sure it is not something else symptoms include shortness of breath also makes me think i am going to die tingly extremities nausea constantly having to use the bathroom headaches and of course the terror not sure what else to say like i said i have been feeling better some things that have definitely helped are therapy exercise hobbies working hard getting up really early and doing the right thing most importantly is the consistency of al of these things

hey guys new here just came over here from the anxiety subreddit because lucky me i have panic disorder and mild depersonalization derealization i am a 25 y o lady and i started having panic attacks and constant anxiety about a year ago a lot has changed in my life in the past year i m in a long distance relationship started down a new career path preparing for a move some family health issues and i feel like the stress of all of that has really converged into a shitstorm of anxiety i used to smoke occasionally and i thought it was triggered initially by a weird high that made me feel paranoid and anxious and out of body but i see now that it is a lot more complicated than that i am really sick of living in a state of anxiety and when my panic really sets in i feel like i am legitimately dying and that scares the crap out of me it is crazy and honestly sometimes so hard to believe that my chest pains and palpitations and nausea and dizziness are all being caused by my anxiety it does not seem rational the other day i had to leave work in the middle of my shift to go to urgent care because i was convinced that i was having a heart attack luckily though i am not alone and i am so glad that there is a little corner on the internet of people who feel like me and people who felt like me but got better i hope i can find support here and return the favor thanks

first time poster here 19 year old male i have panic disorder and i get panic attacks anywhere from 2 5 times a day they are often started by social situations or places where i have previously had a panic attack in particular during a panic attack i think that if i am not with anyone i know then i am being followed by somebody or i am being recorded in some fashion and i am the centerpiece of a grand conspiracy if i am with a someone i know i feel like they are plotting and scheming with their other friends to try and get information out of me that they can later turn and use against me in some manner as to hurt me either by giving me a bad name or possibly fabricating a story about any information i may have told them to hinder me from getting a job or academically etc i am in the constant state of fear that i am being surveyed or that people i know are out to get me and that i can not trust anyone i do not have a fear of death unless the panic attack is bad today i was simply eating lunch with a friend one to one and i saw them fidgeting with their earbuds hanging it around their neck placing it to the side of them on the table and leaning to that side when they were talking i took this as them trying to record me they were asking prodding questions about stuff they never had any prior interest in like my goals for the semester my life and asking me things i knew they already knew i mentioned something i have repeated a million times and they got really loud and were trying to act surprised but to me it did not seem genuine the point is that almost any social situation can and probably has caused me to have a panic attack about it i know also almost for a fact that smoking not cigarettes has brought this about since the onset of these symptoms minor anxiety i have stopped smoking but the panic attacks increase in frequency and severity i have almost run out of options because it is causing me to not trust anyone and in turn it is eating away at all of my relationships i have talked to my parents about it and they know that it was my prior drug use that has brought about the symptoms but i do not think they fully understand that i am still having daily panic attacks but they are the most supportive people in my life how do i stop thinking that my friends have malicious intent it has gotten to the point that even after a panic attack i still have feelings that they should not be trusted i seriously do not know where to go from here and it is very scary i met with a therapist for the first time today but my next appointment is not until a week later and i am not sure i can hold my sanity until then as i am sure this weekend my friends will want to hang out

in the last few months i became very convinced that cortisol levels play a major role in anxiety panic attacks and depression i came to this conclusion through personal blood test results and the changing levels of anxiety through the day that are identical to the cortisol daily cycle starting at very high levels with 30 min of waking up and fluctuating during the day so here is a link to the drugs that i found that could help with lowering cortisol and had success in lowering anxiety depression levels i only selected the drugs that have been researched and my main source of information was us national library of medicine national institutes of health i collected the useful data in a word document which you can download at this link hope it will be useful to some and would like to hear your thoughts about it the difficult part is finding a doctor who has a good understanding in psychiatry and endocrinology and who would have an open mind to new ideas
effects of cortisol levels on anxiety and depression

how can i help my boyfriend
you lovely people may or may not remember me but i posted a while back about something or other i know what i am doing is not normal the response i got from you as a community helped me take that step to getting help first an update i am on medication it is helping heck i am even driving now i am doing things at work making mistakes and figuring out how to fix it instead of dreading the doom that will surely be visited on me my department has grown by a new member and i am looking into problems for them and the customer service team and i feel like i am handling it well or i feel like i look like i am handling it if that makes no sense the downside maybe my title gave it away i am terrified that everything is going so well that something must be going horribly wrong somewhere and i just have not noticed it yet i am on the waiting list for a psychiatrist but that is another story involving my manager making me cancel an appointment which in the nhs is like finding gold and i have not heard anything back from them since sighs still impostor syndrome or whatever i feel like i am just waiting for something to go wrong why i do not know to prove that little demon on my shoulder right let me know if this is the wrong subreddit guys 3 i do not want to be cluttering up things with posts in the wrong place
everything is going so well what is the catch
i go to a relatively large school in the midwest and now as i am about to begin my sophomore year my roommate wants me to go out to parties with him but i just can t i feel like some kind of freak because partying is what college is all about right he is fairly understanding about it but even when the subject of going out to parties is brought up my heart starts racing i feel a shot of adrenaline my stomach gets upset and i start sweating i am worried that by not going to parties i am missing out on a big part of being a young person when i do not go to parties i end up feeling awful about myself because i start to think about how we only have one life to live and i am not using my time to enjoy life along with not going to parties i have the problem of not being able to meet any friends at school because the main way of meeting friends is at parties if i cannot even manage to meet new friends how the hell am i going to meet a girl someday to marry as it is i have only ever had one girlfriend and i am a 19 year old virgin i guess the main point of what i am saying is that i am a young person who does not seem to like any of the things that most young people like because of this i become worried that i am not doing something right and wasting my youth is there anyone here in a similar situation and if so how do you deal with it and how is it different for you
i am in my second year of college and i have not been to a single party yet
i am usually a bit anxious but i have just been having a ton of anxiety lately 6 full on panic attacks in about as many weeks triggers have included nova cane at the dentist touching someone s hand and worrying they had drugged me with a rare date rape drug that soaks through the skin tomatoes corn a frozen banana and most recently nothing like i just had or am having but am trying to keep cool about a panic attack over nothing there i was taking magnesium before bed like always i walk in the bedroom and convince myself that i feel weird and shoooommm i can feel the chemical dump from my brain i wonder if i am having blurry vision or are the lights just out then i remember that blurry vision was a symptom of the anxiety medicine i have been prescribed and am not taking too scary then i wonder if i have accidentally taken it instead of magnesium and then a second wave of anxiety chemicals hits it is been really hard to live like this i am not depressed but i am terrified of all kinds of irrational things and knowing that they are irrational does not stop it with the banana i thought of calling my boyfriend at work to ask him if that banana in the freezer was okay because i thought i might have accidently poisoned myself with a banana it sounds just as weird to me as it does to you it is really stressful not that i had wish this on anyone but if there is someone who recognizes themselves in this i had really like to talk to someone about it
fear of drugs being drugged
hey cannot believe i am posting this i know none of you are doctors but i would love any insight into what could be wrong with me i am 18 i have always been socially anxious when i was about 11 i developed a mild stutter that really affected my confidence i never stuttered at home it s always been psychological as stuttering is but at school in an attempt to hide it completely i would think of what i was going to say before i ever spoke this sort of lead to me developing a severe fear of stuttering and hence a block stutter which is not the classic stutter with repetitions it is a repressed stutter i always know when i am having difficulty with speech some days especially mornings before i have warmed up i feel like i can only say about 50 of the words i want to say i am a covert stutterer though no one hears a block or stutter because i can choose to not say difficult words it is so linked to my mood and when i am totally relaxed i notice that i can slip into fluent speech without noticing this has all lead to severe crippling anxiety surrounding social situations and speech i have developed some odd anxiety symptoms and feel like i am losing my mind in classroom type situations even though my speech can be fine and i have obv never been mute i have this huge sense of having no control over my body or what i am capable of doing and i fear that i am actually unable to speak at all what i mean is i will sit there in class frozen up and dying on the inside my thoughts are always if i have to speak right now i might be mute how do i know that i could speak rn if i had to this comes along with a lot of depersonalisation derealisation during these panic episodes i feel like i am totally out of my body my stuttered speech is totally psychological i tried mdma and was incredibly fluent as i am when i am home alone not interested in therapy i think helping my anxiety will help my speech a lot i just do not think talking to someone would help and medication worries me so i am not sure what to do and i am scared another odd thing coffee transforms my mood it gives me the will to live and almost balances me out in turn i have much lower anxiety much more incentive to meet people and much better speech i am not an adhd sufferer at all why does caffeine have a profound mental effect on me and help me thanks so much for reading to clarify my main issue is the incredibly horrible fear of being mute when the anxiety hits because i do feel mute and unable to control my speech i am aware that all this fear about speech is likely to do with internalised fear towards my small stutter i am big on trying to sort your own shit out if possible what would be the best strategy i am aware that the brain fucks up when you think about body functions too much would it be wise for me to try and forget about speech entirely during these anxiety attacks then they might lessen finally does this sound like severe anxiety panic disorder i manage to get through life but honestly i am beginning to feel like i am extremely mentally ill i mean i cannot manage a severe fear of being mute when i have never been mute in the stressful situations that trigger the anxiety what do i do i ve been prescribed beta blockers but they obv only control bodily response to fear and hence do not help this nightmare
fear of losing ability to speak regular episodes terrible

help calming down
hi i am new at this panicparty although i have been partying for some years now with some times of relief in the middle i just wanted to introduce myself because i am really glad to find another space of comprehension for this invisible suffering i have been doing therapy and phsycology trainings since some years now learning to take care of myself and to understand myself better so i can decrypt what my body is trying to tell me i am in a support group too and that has been a huge thing for me because people not understanding this is one of the biggest fountains of suffering i have with this kind of comments you should distract yourself everybody has problems you are just oversensitive you have to you bury yourself etc and consider that i have generally been with an active and autonomus attitude it is not like i have been decades in my sofa feeling bad and trying nothing which could happen as well and for me deserves help and compassion but some people just do not understand because they never experienced it or they just do not feel compassionated about this sorry today i am specially angry with that i am spanish so that is why my english may sound weird see you later
new at the party
a little history i m mid 40s male history of depression not suicidal about a year ago i had a panic attack that sent me to the hospital because i thought i was having a heart attack i had a few episodes since but have learned to address the panic as soon as it starts and that usually works typically i start to feel like i cannot breathe and then i get flush heart races and i get dizzy and nauseous it always starts with a struggle to breathe or a dizzy flush feeling this morning it started after i woke up i felt sort of claustrophobic which i have never felt before then i got dizzy in the shower the claustrophobic feeling got worse and i felt like i could not breathe then came the nausea and dizziness accompanied by panic and a sense of fear dread then while still in the shower i started wondering if this is the beginning of some type of mental illness and that is when my panic escalated and i thought i was going to pass out it seems that my anxiety starts with a physical symptom and then i freak myself out about it and make things worse i am wondering if this is common for how others feel experience anxiety or if maybe something else might be going on i have an appointment with my doctor this afternoon but thought i had see if anyone else had experience like this because my doctor has admitted to not understanding anxiety thanks
i am having anxiety attacks that start as physical symptoms is this normal
a bit of background i suffer from anxiety i just graduated from college i was hoping to go to medical school but my parents were unable to help me financially my mother has racked up 60 000 in debt and my hope that my parents could help me out with rent when my savings ran out were crushed instead of moving back home another state and starting over and dealing with my parents nasty divorce i was offered a job in my college state i chose to stay here and to move in with my so who is still job searching i start my job on monday i am staying with extended family for a few weeks until i can afford an apartment and cannot help but feel like i am imposing i have maybe 60 to get me through the next week i have never been so uncomfortable everything is new everything is up in the air and the air feels pretty thin right now does anyone have advice for how to help me cope i was on sertraline for depression anxiety but stopped about a month ago after being tired of dealing with withdrawals and feeling like my life was stable enough for me to be okay but right now i wish i had stayed on it i do not like feeling like i have to rely on prescriptions to manage my emotions
nobody tells you how terrifying it is to be an adult does anyone have advice to help me calm down for a bit
i have been suffering from anxiety for a few years now i survived through college for the most part my problem right now is that i have a girlfriend of 8 months and i cannot seem to stop constantly worrying about what she is doing we live far apart from each other because we both just graduated college and moved back home she is not much of a texter so we do not talk all day but most nights we talk on the phone i have recently discovered that facebook tells you when a person was on facebook last and a lot of times i would send her a message seeing that she was just on facebook a minute ago and i would not get a response for an hour even though during the course of that hour i see that she keeps going on facebook my mind starts to think why is she ignoring me who could she be talking to instead of me what could she be doing it would be so easy for her to cheat on me and i would never know about it and my mind goes off on this tangent like a snowball rolling downhill and it really upsets me i start to feel really down and isolate myself it kills my motivation to eat to hang with friends to do anything i normally enjoy doing i just wish i could get rid of these thoughts i know i can trust her but once these thoughts start to come i cannot seem to stop them i have talked to her about this a number of times and she is been very supportive but she does not seem to understand what i am going through because she feels sad that i do not trust her and that she is done nothing wrong for me not to trust her which she is absolutely right she thinks that our relationship is strong and it upsets her that i do not feel the same way this really frustrates me because its not because of her and she takes it personally and i wish she wouldn t i do not know how to show her that and i am afraid that if this continues she will want to leave me because i am not strong enough or good enough or she will find someone that does not have this problem and leave me for him i feel like i am being high maintenance i do not know what to do
i just want to talk to someone that understands me
first of all i apologize if this is all over the place its hard for me to think straight right now i have been feeling awful for the past few days maybe a week i do not know anymore i have these obsessive thoughts that scare me and make me upset whenever i think about my girlfriend now or if i text her i start thinking about death and about how little time it feels like there is and about the end and i fear losing her even though that is years and years in the future i start thinking that life and everything is pointless and i break down i know these thoughts are irrational and i should not have them but i cannot help it i find it almost impossible to imagine not having these thoughts anymore and hard to imagine being as happy as i was before this started i am seeing a therapist soon and i am going to see my psychiatrist about a week after that but i cannot wait for that i want to be better now i do not know how to help myself my mom says she thinks i have ocd i have been diagnosed with gad and depression in the past and my medicine venlafaxine seems to have been helping with those please help me i hate living like this every day i am more than happy to answer any questions if that would help you understand my problem further
i feel so terrible i need advice
going on two years of a generalized anxiety disorder now i have had bumps ups and downs and moments of clarity but also moments of sheer insanity or so it feels i had aparticularly bad month in april and the first half of may however about two weeks ago something clicked and my anxiety shut off it felt great work felt great i could drive to work 1hr both ways with little to no fear meetings going for walks etc was no problem fast forward to this weekend and i had a stupid intrusive thought that set me off a weird lightheaded feeling dumb i knew when i had that thought it would set me off on a spiral work was fine today until about an hour ago now i am suffering from a small medium panic attack again over nothing stupid depressive thoughts or what ifs i attribute my recent healing to listening to talk radio non stop when i am not working even when i wake up early in the morning i have continued to do this but it seems like my armor is wearing off not interested in a coping mechanism per se or even a way to disract myself more than talk radio can do i know you cannot run from this and believe me i have tried what are some positive things i can do when having an attack at work or in traffic two particularly bad places for me where there is no escape
small step forward but then two steps back
so i do not know if this is where i put in the obligatory first time poster thing or what but i have known about reddit for a while only recently started browsing it by the way i am sorry if this is the wrong subreddit to post this in maybe i should explain i know i have a panic disorder i have struggled with depression and self harming and my panic attacks generally consist of hiding in a corner shaking crying and either biting myself or scratching my arms digging my nails into my arms also i am sorry if this is written badly describing my feelings does not come easily to me but it is less difficult when it is words on a screen i can almost pretend it is a story stories help me escape from the usual thoughts of low self esteem you know the ones you re fat you are ugly you are broken anyway it first dawned on me that i had some sort of panic disorder at my first job it was a mess i will spare the details to preserve the data protection act suffice it to say when someone who has been working in her first job for 10 months fresh out of getting a level 3 diploma in childcare and has been struggling with panic attacks and this was known to the manglement by the way do not put them in charge of the baby room for a day consisting of ten infants ranging from 0 2 years some of whom had medical requirements and with only an apprentice a new employee and an utterly useless student to help breaking more than a few laws in the process i bit myself so hard in my last week there that i left bruises on my arms both of them i was hitting my head against the wall brooms scratching my arms i walked out and did not go back that same year someone i loved like a grandfather had died and i got pulled into the office a few weeks later and was told you are not as cheerful as you normally are it does not matter what is going on you leave your feelings at the door by the day manager the same day manager suggested that i seek professional help when she saw the bruises on my arms the friday i walked out and never went back it was not a great year for me i will admit it was not easy to have the courage to get help least of all because of lack of support from my mother if you might have these issues what does this mean for me not to mention the screaming about how she wanted to kill herself sometimes after i had admitted to her that i had contemplated suicide but oh well but i got cbt and it helped for a while i have a new job in a completely different field and i like it there it is a good place but i have noticed something aside from the occasional panic attacks i know about those i can deal with them but these i do not know how to describe them it is my own mind telling me this no mistake but they are like orders urges they take over my thoughts hit your head against that wall hit your head hit your head make it bleed hit your head hit your head and it is usually accompanied with this massive feeling of dread scratch your arms scratch them scratch them scratch them dig your nails in dig dig dig make them bleed make them hurt make them bleed it does not make me feel better i feel ashamed of myself i know it is not right but what do i do every time it happens i have this overwhelming feeling that something is going to go wrong that i have to do this like it is a punishment for something that really i know i have not done wrong i talk to a customer on the phone i hang up and for a while i am okay then it hits digdigscratchyourarms scratchthemscratchthem you are bad you are broken look at you you are disgusting and it will not leave me alone until i give in it was ten fifteen minutes of me sat at my desk today taptaptapping with all of the fingers on my hand while it felt like something was in my left forearm and the only way to get rid of that feeling was to dig in with my nails that the only way to get these thoughts to stop was to give in i won today i did not give in but what about next time is this just me how do i deal with this i do not want to talk to my family i once i do not know whether it was because i had had a bad day or what but i was in the kitchen doing my laundry and suddenly i knew about the knives the sharp ones the ones that could do the most damage and i was not sure i could stop myself i started screaming bloody murder making sure i would not go anywhere until someone came my older brother came to see what the fuss was about no one else moved mother probably did not know she is hearing impaired and she has been all her life so it has not exactly been plain sailing for her either but he sat with me until i started to calm down and then mother walked by and made a face at me you know the one where someone imitates a crying face at you my brother told her to go away and the day after my irate father turned up wanting to know why my brother and i had told her to f off anyway that is why i do not raise this with my family i have not told them what i am really thinking because i am sure mother would just come up with something even worse that happened to her sometimes i just want to drive off a bridge she screamed one night after the toilet blocked and my brothers and i were trying to unblock it she wanted to use the toilet and it was the only one in the house so i cannot talk to her she also insults my personal hygiene which does wonders for my self esteem mother have you eaten fish lately or has it just been that time of the month for you all right do not get upset i love you too mother dearest i think a character from a computer game who murdered all of her children is more pleasant than you aside note has anyone noticed how fondly the night mother talks about cicero how sad she seems for him my brothers i do not want to bother them and my father s only just going back to work after being off on sick for five months by sithis what a sorry mess i am tl dr i get mental orders from myself to hit my head on things or to bite scratch my arms that are nearly impossible to ignore how do other redditors cope with this please let me know if the formatting does not make sense i will do my best to amend it update i have booked an appointment at the doctor s in a few weeks time i will take an adapted version of this post with me and see how it goes update 2 went to the doctor today he is referred me to the point of access team for another course of cbt because i felt it helped me the last time i went for it and i have got some medication to see if it helps of course there ll be follow up appointments to this but i feel like it s maybe not progress exactly because i have not gone anywhere but i feel like something s being done i am doing something about this
i know what i am doing is not normal but how do i cope

do you think we should talk about our mental health earlier in life

my mom passed away at the end of january it was really complicated and surprising i was totally blindsided i took a week off and have kept it together for two months went through crazy changes at work and now it feels like it is catching up with me i have had severe panic disorder and agoraphobia for a decade or more but it was almost completely under control after two years of therapy cbt i went from a shut in to a full time people facing employee after my mom died with the expected situational depression came even worse panic every morning i wake up with it i cannot talk or move i shake i sweat profusely and the nausea is intense it is hours of this if i am lucky i can breathe my way out of it and make it into work i am not usually very lucky and have to take meds and delay going in i have tried waking up at 6am to give myself time but the panic arrives on its own timetable i guess i am really exhausted from fighting it from the insomnia and from managing attacks at work fleeing to the bathroom to breathe is really hard when you are a main point of contact for everyone i am not eating because nausea and that is not helping much either my company is growing and we are bursting at the seams while we get a new office so the crowding and extreme noise make work incredibly difficult as well because of the agoraphobia it s not gone it is never gone just muted i feel like a terrible employee and a worse human being because of having to rely on my team so much constant guilt at the same time i feel really upset that i cannot mourn my mom the way i need to does anyone have any advice on this should i bite the bullet and ask for some more time off to properly handle this am i just being lazy and silly i do not want to let down my team i really love my job and work and part of the reason i feel so bad is because i know how much my performance is suffering thanks everyone

i have just been hired as a front desk receptionist for a small spa and i am excited and optimistic for the opportunity but i am also very prone to panic attacks which has made it difficult for me to continue school and live in a big city i am worried that my panic could cost me my new job if i am not super careful or that it will cause me a lot of pains i regularly get on the verge of a large attack but only once and a while do i actually boil over and enter a full blown panic episode i do not have any constant triggers it is more like on my bad days everything becomes a potential catalyst for an attack sometimes i cannot even smell coffee without my heart rate going crazy and getting lightheaded i have been able to hold down a solid 15 credits of school since september and along the way i discovered more about my panic and how to work around it some mornings i will wake up and know that i am going to have an attack later in the day so i will not travel the 45 minutes of public transportation to sit in a crowded classroom does anyone have any advice for upholding a job while prone to panic attacks should i inform my boss what about any future bad days i might have and how to call in an absence in that case

i am in school right now and i am never able to stop freaking out i am constantly shakey and have really shallow breathing help
how can you get over anxiety during school
i have been suffering from anxiety issues for the past 8 years and it does not seem to be getting better little things worry me to the point that i feel like i cannot function and just want to be alone until i calm down i feel like the anxiety causes me to be easily agitated and depressed most of the time many of my friends ask why i am not being myself but just do not seem to understand when i try to explain so i keep everything to myself now i am single and that stresses me constantly many times i have thought it would help tremendously to have someone i can trust and talk with to help me deal with issues i have tried several medicines that do not work but succeed in making me fee like crap people who have never experienced it just do not understand what it is like to have anxiety when i do try to talk about my issues i get the feeling people think i am whining i guess they do not really know what to say so their response is generic i e oh or ok hopefully i have found a place where i can say how i am feeling and have others understand thanks for listening
understanding what it is like to live with anxiety
so my mom recently found out that she has a benign tumor which really freaked her out and this anxiety escalated possibly partly due to the stress she has been under for the past few years with my father recovering from a life threatening disease it is gotten to the point where her doctor prescribed antidepressants to stop her crippling panic attacks and she is easily triggered by medical imagery talk of surgery tumors etc i live abroad so i cannot be there for her except when i am home on breaks like past christmas but we keep in touch a lot luck would have it that now my boyfriend also has a tumor except a malignant and possibly life threatening one which obviously is a lot for me to take normally i would immediately share this with my mom and she would shower me with love and support but i just do not know if she would be able to take it in her present state she is never met my boyfriend we ve only been dating for a few months but it still might hit a bit too close to home and i do not want to make her situation worse on the other hand it might also turn her away from her own concerns or put them in perspective but i feel like that is quite a big risk to take i would really appreciate some advice on what to do especially since i have never experienced anxiety like my mom s though i am now starting to get a taste so i find it hard to predict what this will do to her thanks in advance
should i tell my mother suffering from severe anxiety about the stuff that is going on in my life bf has cancer
hi so pretty new here but it is really nice to know there is a subreddit for nearly everything including anxiety so uh i recently developed major flight anxiety while flying to see my s o who is half a world away i m in se asia he is in north europe and it has made all our current plans for the near future extremely difficult for one i was due to fly home a few days ago but i missed the flight because i had my first major panic attack at the thought of flying terrorism plane crashing you name it i was just so scared of the flight then there was the fear of basically everything horrible happening afterwards even if i did make it home safely i have been meditating and praying but that only goes so far and any small trigger like people screaming in a video or my dad linking me to news of the jakarta attack today just brings all my anxiety to the forefront all over again and i do not know how to cope at all having cancelled and rebooked once i had rather not cancel my upcoming flight again especially since my tourist visa will expire fairly soon after then and i had like to get back for chinese new year too i cannot see a therapist or psychiatrist until i fly back though so any help in calming down and getting myself on the plane without too much fuss would be super appreciated
scared about flying home

this website called 7 cups of tea helped pull me off the brink i hope it will help you

i like this article s suggestion on how to improve our mental health through improving our thinking and feeling patterns
so long story short weed has reached a point for me considering a few things such as my tolerance pattern of use and predisposition for anxiety where everytime i smoke what i thought was up to a certain level if you will i get anxious rapid pulse sweats sometimes a need to be stagnant and comfortable in my car room some of you may know all too well for those of you that don t it can be scary only once or twice did it ever feel so severe that it reached beyond my logical brain to freak me out but generally speaking i know what i am dealing with here that being said i reached such a point a year and a half to two years ago now and it was stressful then i quit for what was at most a week and resumed use feeling better over the period between then and now i eventually began using on that level again fast forward to a month ago at this point i started to have a few days in particular that really freaked me out one day after i renounced weed for the foreseeable upcoming month i had a fake out heart attack which luckily my family was present for and did not effect me beyond some pretttty bad panic now it is been over three weeks and on halloween in addition to a few beers i had tried smoking again it was not much the half ashy remnants of a stranger s plastic sherlock pipe at a party for 2 still i felt fine i should stress that i did not try too much here anyway however the next day i decided to try just a bowl of one of my smaller bongs test things out well though it was not as bad as the other day i had described it pretty much skyrocketed to some pretty intense pulse action and lightheadedness since yesterday i have been pretty good especially knowing now for certain weed is the triggering cause so now i have a few questions to pose to you the lovely stoners of reddit the first question s are those in the title what should i do in general and what are some of your experiences with this kind of situation moving on though i have a few other smaller questions perhaps it is just the bag i have had which has been the same stuff for a while which was not hitting me like that when i had first gotten it so perhaps i need to give things more time all questions towards alleviating this issue then of course and lastly there is the issue of what this means for me for my use habit if it is necessary to discontinue i value my young college brain and future more than this weed lifestyle i have had the last 4 odd years but there are challenges that come with such a sudden potential halt in my weed smoking first of all many of the few friends i have left in this particularly puzzling time of my life are stoners and my personality itself along with a lot of my thinking patterns are kind of absorbed remnants of the general effects pot s had on me as a person so for me to forsake smoking is fine but it also means i am removing a sort of piece of my mentality to a degree furthermore i had love to date the kind of chick who smokes i cannot see myself really going for a chick who does not or at least has never i do not want my peers and such potential future partners to judge me this is all very confusing as you can imagine and this seems like a community i can reach out to thanks for reading if you took time out of your day to read all the way down here
posted this in r trees guess it was too serious for them could use some advice
hey all i mentioned a few weeks ago i thought i had sleepwalked and now the anxiety has come back curse you anxiety disorder i have an app called hot or not which i noticed has quite alot of data used during the night i thought i have sleepwalked i am nervous i might have sent something horrible or something on it and i am gonna get in trouble my computer wizz brother assures me that even though its foreground data it was probably an update i cant find any weird messages sent but what if that person blocked me or something and thats the reason i cant see it i know its probably really stupid but its keeping me up at night and i just cant function properly apparently it requires a reply from that person to send an image i dont know but its upsetting me thoughts

hey all i am posting for my boyfriend who recently started having severe panic attacks he has never been diagnosed with a mental health disorder and this seemingly started out of nowhere for him he had one about 3 months ago it was tough but eventually he calmed down and forgot about it however he had one last night that was so bad he almost went to the emergency room out of fear he was having a heart attack his symptoms include tingling numbness in his hands arms feelings of fullness in his body shortness of breath sweating chest pain etc his mother is a nurse and diagnosed him with panic attacks here s the problem he cannot get in to see a psychiatrist for another 4 weeks minimum i have called tons of offices around here and they do not accept new patients for quite some time my boyfriend is about to start a new job where he will be travelling for 3 weeks so he is nervous about having another attack while travelling for work as someone who has some knowledge of mental health disorders i know he needs some sort of xanax like medicine to take only when he feels these attacks coming on i also know that a lot of doctors especially at hospitals urgent care centers who would be able to see him right away are wary to prescribe that kind of stuff in the usa because of widespread drug abuse should he even bother to go to the walk in clinic or will it be a waste of time what kind of facility can he go to within the next 4 days that can prescribe him what he needs has anyone dealt with anything like this before i want to help him but i am at a loss tl dr my boyfriend needs to get medicine for his panic attacks right away but cannot get in to see a psychiatrist for another month what should he do
help my boyfriend has debilitating panic attacks cannot see a psychiatrist for over 4 weeks what kind of doctor should he see

as a person with mental illness this approach helped me deal with my environment intentionally and avoid feeling embarassed or conform to social norms just because of my mental health challenges
i was reading a post about how the person thought her anxiety was going to be a seizure and i noticed how she had constant peeing as a symptom and that is how i am getting i cannot drink or eat anything without having to pee right after i pee probably twice an hour and if not i am in pain it is way too much for what i am eating and drinking does anyone else have this problem and know it is from anxiety what do you do about it and another question have you had issues with sexual abuse
i have extremely bad anxiety and i have to pee all the time is anyone else going through this

do you know that most conversations about mental health help break the stigma

did you know not having close friends and cliques during adolescence may be detrimental for future health
i am currently switching meds and have been on the new one vortioxetine for a month or so not sure if that could be influencing what is happening or not in the past year or so i went to a restaurant with my friend and had a panic attack there since then i have been very anxious to go to any restaurant and struggle when i end up at one my anxiety triggers what i believe to be ibs abd i end up getting bad abdominal cramps which just make me even more anxious i have always gotten anxious when i get stomach aches and such and can be considered emetophobic as well as of current i seem to have developed an anxious reaction after eating even in my own house especially to cold drinks and icecream etc i am sure there is a word or phobia to describe what i am experiencing whenever i have heightened periods of anxiety i end up eating less having no appetite which even causes weight loss i had a similar situation almost exactly a year ago i am on the waitlist to go back to my therapist but i was told it could take 8 10 weeks and school starts in 1 week does anyone have similar experiences or ideas for coping with these phobias ibs etc
anxiety phobia help
i am 19 f and i have had epilepsy for 6 years and have generalized seizures i take keppra for that so when i started having what i now understand to be panic attacks i initially thought i was in an aura and about to have a seizure they felt like this and progressed 1 warmth over heated light headed fatigued spacey immediately recognizable 2 nasusea extreme panic fear and anxiety repeated bathroom use for stomach but only to urinate 3 tremors start mild in hands then it feels like it starts in my chest and ripples across whole body like shivering almost crippling fear anxiety induced hysteria paired with crying 4 insomnia it is caused me to have to go home from several locations and even made me miss school because in my head i was about to seize i only learned yesterday from my nuerologist that this was not seizure activity my brain is unable to separate an attack from an aura due to stress being a trigger for a seizure i wonder if anyone can identify did you start a small medication how does it affect your day to day
diagnosed with panic attacks but there is more
i have never been to a mental health professional and cannot see one now due to lack of health insurance us citizen about a month ago or so i had a panic attack while under the influence and it damaged me very badly during my attack i felt like i was insane and or mentally retarded it was one of the scariest moments in my entire life ever since then any panic attack i have i get the same fear it is an overwhelming fear and seriously makes me question my sanity now it affects my work as an artist crippling my ability to complete projects because of this fear that i am actually terrible at what i do and everyone is either laughing at me behind my back or patronizing me somehow by wanting to work with me or complimenting my work it does not help the fact that i am already a perfectionist with very low self esteem i do not know what to do i want to seek help but i lack the funds i guess i just needed a place to vent as i do not like talking to my friends or family about this stuff
i have been having bad attacks and fear it is just going to get worse

this article made me realized how detrimental stigma against ourselves can be and inspired me to be more self confident
i cannot deal with rejection
want to ask my brother if i can come up to his room and chill but i am always scared he will say no not tonight
my fh suffers from anxiety that often results in panic attacks which often happen right when we are supposed to be doing something like getting on a flight i am trying my best to be supportive but i am struggling with a the disappointment of constantly missing out on plans we have made and b the financial fallout i know he feels bad when i am disappointed and when we have spent x that are non refundable or used vacation days we cannot get back so i do not want to bring it up and make it worse but at the same time we are not made of money and blowing hundreds of dollars is a bit stressful any suggestions on how to deal with this do any of you have things that help you ride out panic attacks to at least attend but ideally be able to actually enjoy important events i am especially concerned about this as we plan for our wedding for obvious reasons

it is a little expensive about 4400 jpy but i am not exactly sure what it is but i am desperate and do not want to beg a doctor for meds here are some pics of it
i am having really bad anxiety since i drank again last weekend i found this otc natural medicine in japan and think it might be for anxiety or to go to sleep
so i just got home from a session of pathfinder and as soon as i walked through the door my hands begin shaking they are still somewhat shaky but i can still kind of type then my brain randomly decides to think about the worst possible scenarios it can think of and it freaks me the f out so my imagination is not mine anymore at the moment and it is venturing to unknown places even imagining myself killing random people it keeps popping up and each death is specific for each person for example there s a lot but i am too lazy to list all scenarios nor do i want to freak myself out even more by writing in detail i imagine this girl i am interested in killing herself then my dad getting in a car accident my mom does not seem to have died yet in my imagination nor have my siblings it just seems to be people i am really affectionate for and then of course i am just thinking of going on the street and just randomly stabbing people next up i randomly picture random people i have seen on the news typically teenagers who have committed suicide just appear in my bedroom like through the reflection of my monitor i turn around of course there is nothing there i also have a weird feeling that the power is going to go out and i am going to get choked by some weird ghost type figure strangely enough it feels like i need to be on skype or calling someone to feel secure even though i am extremely introverted and stay to myself almost every single day my heart is beating normally but it does not feel that way it also feels like there is a massive elephant standing on my chest and it feels weird to breathe and also as mentioned before the shaky hands i have ocd and i think there is some minor mental illnesses on my dad s side of the family if that makes any difference i also get really jumpy so most things scare me yes i am a coward smile so i do not exactly enjoy the ghost part of things nor do i enjoy the power outage idea i have never really had this issue before so why is this happening to me now any help would be greatly appreciated p s nothing even remotely traumatic to trigger these so i typically have thoughts about people dying which i believe is ocd related but everything is brand new and extremely weird so the big anxiety thing about it only happened once if and when should i seek assistance
what exactly is this and when should i seek help

post traumatic stress disorder
in the past year i have started having mildly frequent panic attacks and very frequent anxiety usually caused by social and self esteem issues every time i have a panic attack i always repeat i m sorry i am sorry because i feel like such a burden to everyone and that i am a disruption i also feel really embarrassed and ashamed its expected that i an 18 year old guy be strong and have control over my emotions but i am very emotional some times i guess it makes sense since i am a theater kid and so i always feel weak for crying and having panic attacks around other people does anyone else experience this and if so do you have any advice
i feel guilty and weak after panic attacks any advice re post from r anxiety

i feel like mental health awareness needs to be more out in the open therapyhelped
my mental health tends to be cyclical i had say this is a throaway i am not diagnosed unfortunately basically i find myself trusting people and knowing they do but then i panic any ways and it sends me into a spiral of the past i am very affected by bullying still from my school years i worry constantly i cannot stop it there are times when my brain seems to shut off and i calm down but then i panic about anything if something likes the same thing as me i feel like they like it more than me i feel like nothing is mine i cannot enjoy reading or movies or almost anything my brain is always overturning and going like some wheel i don t i genuinely don t remember a time where i felt normal i just do not know where to go and while the internet is a distraction barely i am also lonely as fuck i know you guys are not doctors i just panic all the time i am suspicious but always fucking always trusting of people why the fuck do i do this god i am a fucking idiot i just wish my brain would stop i go from feeling intensely anxious to feeling sometimes numb and actually happy when this happens and then it fades and i feel depressed i am not sure why i am typing this i have vented before on reddit and it is no one s fault but i have just never felt better afterwards i realize you are not medical professionals i just do not know where to go and i am too afraid to talk to anyone i know nobody understands me i feel like nobody cares i am always here for people this is sounding like me me me me me but i find nobody wants anything to do with me nobody wants to talk to me i am afraid to share my opinions with people or anything i feel like nobody cares as much as i do i feel things intensely i can never capitalized on that happy numb state i feel it always ends up going away
i am not sure where to go throw away

i will try to keep this brief i am about 2 years out of mormonism i have been married for over 10 years and everything has been great for a long time my wife and are deeply in love and feel very strong in our relationship even now that religion is no longer a part of it i started to notice when we were finding new friends and associating with them that i was becoming increasingly uncomfortable with the idea that she could find attraction towards another man and even want to act on that attraction sure enough she experienced some feelings for a friend of ours nothing actually happened but after i confronted her about her feelings i m pretty observant we had an amazing moment of connection where we were able to acknowledge that feelings are ok and it happens to normal human beings soon after this however i noticed that i was having uncontrollable fears about her wanting to be close to him i would imagine 20 different scenarios all of them negative they would take control of me and i would just spiral out of control i told my wife what i was feeling and we decided i must be experiencing some form of anxiety and i decided the best way to handle it was to talk openly about it with her she is my best friend and we have gotten much closer because of it the problem is it is not going away i find that the idea of her going out with friends me staying home causes me to freak out because she might flirt or be attracted to someone else i find that i get easily agitated and i am more sensitive to completely banal things and have to kind of talk myself down to try to be normal again this typically happens about once per week sometimes less though what stinks is that i am about 6 months into this and tonight my wife was going out with friends i was trying really hard to control my feelings but just before she left i reacted poorly to something she said and realized i was spinning up and soon i was crying uncontrollably trying to manage my imagination and fear of what might be i am not sure where to go next i do not want to take strong medication but i have not even started therapy or much of anything else i figured that i was going through a phase because i was leaving religion i love my wife and my family i do not want to hurt them with my anxiety and panic issues it makes my wife sad

if i need the meds i will need the quick chuckle
i have always had a really hard time describing panic attacks to other people i can explain the physical stuff like racing heartbeat and shallow breathing but it is hard to explain what is going on in my mind but today i found a way to do it a friend asked me what my panic attacks were like i told her that it is like this you know when you are in that class you hate and you feel like it is never going to end you look at the clock after 20 min and it turns out it is only been 3 minutes but you cannot leave you just have to get through it and you start thinking and joking to yourself ahhh i am going to die in this class it is taking forever this is a pretty common experience right well my panic attacks are like that but my heart starts racing and i hyperventilate and want to cry and my whole body hurts but cant stop moving so i actually think and physically feel like i might die in that class anyway that is what i told my friend and i think it helped to give a better idea of how i feel in the moment just wanted to share because i am proud i found a way to express it and thought it may help some others
describing my panic attacks to others

tips for panic attacks during class
beginning about three months ago i have been experiencing a series of strange and terrifying incidents typically they will occur when i am surrounded by a large number of people the first thing i will notice is that things generally seem off for some reason background noise seems to fade away but i become acutely aware of my surroundings i experience an overwhelming sense of dread my stomach drops and i can feel my heart pounding in my chest when this happens time seems to slow down this is not like how time seems to drag when i am bored i am literally seeing everyone around me moving in slow motion their movements also seem slightly jerky almost like i am seeing things at a lower frame rate i feel like everyone else is looking at me and everything feels surreal these tend to last for maybe half an hour and gradually things return to normal sometimes i can feel one coming on and i am able to distract myself or change my environment and it goes away do these incidents sound like panic attacks i am worried that because i am literally seeing things in fucking slow motion that this could be an early sign of psychosis or something and that terrifies me
does this sound like a panic attack or some other form of mental illness
hi all i was very nervous about driving to work today after a very bad weekend of anxiety but i poured some chamomile tea into a mug and sipped it whenever my heart rate started going up on the drive i have been here for over an hour and no problems so far i hope this helps you

i cannot literally breathe i need to hold my breath to subdue the panic i am feeling i am unbearably nauseous i realised that i am on track to fail the semester the coming days are going to be literally constant work 15 20 hour days just trying to stay afloat and even then i am still in a bad place it is never been this hard for me to succeed before i don t know how to make this stop
currently in a state of severe panic it is not stopping it is never been this bad
hi all my panic disorder is basically i am constantly afraid of getting a panic attack so i tend to hold back on things that i do well yesterday i went to see a concert with a friend in brooklyn because i have been pretty good the past few months i have seen some concerts and it has not been a problem we took a train 2 subways and then a lot of walking and we finally got there then the thoughts started coming what if i start to feel one where could i go what could i do i could tell it was not going away even after i took 5mg of my ativan i decided to go home i felt pretty bad because my friend wanted to stay but i just could not stay there she decided to stay at the concert no big deal i had rather be alone during these situations anyway so i got in a taxi and it just kept getting worse i was visibly shaking i needed to take another pill i think i had one right before getting off at the terminal once i got in the terminal things got back to normal and i was okay but once i got on the train it went right back to it my jaw was clenched so tight that i could barely open it i had one more 5mg of ativan once i changed at the next station i was pretty good because i was only about 15 minutes from my car the rest of the night was fine now i am at work and i have been having these feelings come at me throughout the day they are short of course but i cannot take this forever this just makes untolerable i saw my psychiatrist for the first time in while 2 weeks ago because the attacks were becoming more prevalent he just prescribed me more ativan saying there was not much you could do i guess i am going to see a psychologist because i cannot let this turn me into a recluse is there anything else i can do that you all would recommend i just feel so helpless when the feelings come i do not know how much longer i can take this
i had a bad attack last night and now i cannot shake off the feelings of more

be good to yourself
i am going to take advantage of it by talking to people i usually would not about mental illness and are great resources
october 5th 11th is mental illness awareness week x posted
i wake up everyday and almost always feel guilty for wasting it by the time i go to bed it does not matter how productive i have been that day i always feel this overwhelming guilt at some point like i could have done something better sometimes i stay up really late 4 am 5 am just to give myself an opportunity to enjoy my day so it is not a waste but it usually does not work then if i end up sleeping too late i will wake up and just feel like nothing in my day is even worth doing because i already wasted too much sleeping as a result i get about 4 hours of sleep on average for those wondering i do not just lay around my house all day i know that the things i do are something i paint do crafts talk to family get ready for school in a few weeks etc i am sorry if this is the wrong place it does cause me to have anxiety attacks so i think it fits here i was just wondering if anyone else had the same thing and if they had any help
does anyone else constantly feel guilty for wasting time
hi you have anxiety too or know someone with it i had imagine and i am really glad because not many of my friends family have any fucking idea how awful i feel most of the time and it is not their fault they would help me if they could i do not know what it is like to have arthritis or a goiter or a kidney stone and i am thankful for that really but i also do not brush those things off because i cannot see the x ray that proves they exist this rant really is not about them anyways it is about how much i hate having anxiety i m sorry i will say it right now yeah it is a pity party usually i am pretty strong and able to continue on with my day life but i just need this to go out into the electronic universe to someone anyone who gets it to anyone who understands what it feels like to be going on with your day whether your at work or out with friends or with family you have not seen in forever and you are fine you are enjoying yourself for a few until it starts it could be a strange feeling in your throat maybe you feel light headed or maybe an unusual smells makes you think you are about to have a seizure and die and then it snowballs and wherever you are whatever you are doing does not matter you are no longer present and are being robbed of who you are and your time because all you can think about is what is happening i feel so sick am i about to faint is this it and the rational part of your brain that is a little pussy piece of shit at this point says you know what this is you are fine but it does not matter you still end up in the er a few times even if you are on a date with someone you really really like or a dream job that you have finally landed it does not matter you are a slave to anxiety s your brain s fucking melt down and the explanations get harder and harder to give sorry i think you are really really awesome but we cannot go to the cinema because i might get dizzy and die the days of feeling like this turn into weeks which become months and inevitably years you go to a few doctors who run the standard tests and deem you physically fine you then try meds that may or may not work for you in my case the latter and talk to psychiatrists who are very lovely and understanding but in all honesty cannot possibly imagine what it is like to carry this shit around with you for years upon years upon years unless they too have anxiety and if so then kudos to them i do not mean to stereotype and before you know it you are online trying different methods that might help mostly because it is from someone who seemingly has made it to the other side of zero anxiety charles linden i am looking at you mate zero anxiety how much would you fucking give to never in your life have to deal with this absolute bullshit again i have thought about that a lot and i truly would give a hell of a lot in fact if the bargain was i had have to give up five years of my life so i had live to say 65 instead of 70 i had do it in a heartbeat but then i realize i have already given up 5 years of my life to it so really that number is 60 and i think about the future and that number growing even higher and the thing that kills me is i do not even have this half as bad as some of you out there i can go out though there was a time when i couldn t i can work i have wonderful family and friends and i know that is not the case for so so many and that is why it fucking kills me to bits when people say to me omg if i do not finish this assignment i will have a panic attack or oh i get anxious too everyone gets anxious i know this but it is not the same thing i do not need to tell you this it just feels relieving to say it do you remember what it feels like to not be anxious do you actually remember because it is getting harder and harder for me to to remember what it is like going to a restaurant and not wanting to leave the entire time or going out on the town and being able to just enjoy myself and that scares me beyond belief because i am only 25 and wonder if i will be able to handle the stress yet to come okay i am done and again i am sorry i know there are options like cbt and yes i am actively pursuing solutions but there are times when i am alone and i just scream and cry and scream i know that sounds melodramatic and nic cage esque but it is true and if you are screaming too even if it is silently please know at least one person is listening sigh i feel so much better
just needed a good i f ing hate anxiety rant
hopefully someone here can relate to this and i apologize ahead of time if i begin to rant but i am having a bad day and i really need to get this out i have had anxiety for over 4 years now on and off the last year it has been pretty bad some days i do not even feel like i want to get out of bed today for instance my appetite is shot my heart rate is accelerated and my mind is racing with thoughts this all stemmed from the fact that i was supposed to meet up with a client for web design today you see since i quit my job 8 months ago i have not really left my house all that much probably not a good thing but i cannot really afford that much gas well this lady who is website i was supposed to be redoing lives 30 minutes away all last night i started thinking about the time it will take to get there and i started getting those anxious feelings the tense stomach especially just utter nauseousness i just could not help but thinking what would happen if i got hit with a panic attack on the drive over or what if i got a dizzy spell even though i have not had one for 7 months or what if i got sick at her house just those thoughts and others like it kept going over and over and over on repeat in my mind i slept 8 hours last night but felt like i only got 3 i woke up in a panic and have worried ever since i could barely eat breakfast or lunch i was supposed to meet her at 3 and here it is at 3 20 i ended up calling and telling her i could not come why car trouble in all my years of dealing with this very very few times i have actually said my anxiety as an excuse for why i could not make something usually i will make up something like being sick or car trouble or family issues something that does not seem so bad something that does not seem like my fault i feel that by saying anxiety two things will happen either they will not understand the full extent of what i mean or they will blame me personally for just not sucking it up and going anyway i hate lying about these kinds of things to others my family my friends and myself but it is the only way that i do not feel fully guitly i absolutely hate disappointing people so i figure the less others know the better does anyone else feel the same way about this
i lie to others about my anxiety i cannot help it
i have horrible schoolwork anxiety especially when it comes to writing essays it has nothing to do with my abilities and everything to do with i have no idea i just know that i will put off a piece of schoolwork whatever it is reading taking notes an essay a lab what have you until the last possible second because every time i think about doing it i get anxious and of course the anxiety increases as the due date approaches mind you i am no high school kid i am thirtysomething and in my final year of undergrad if even thinking about schoolwork makes you have a meltdown how do you get it done i have tried breaking it into smaller pieces like working in 15 minute blocks but then i just blow it off thinking to myself enh i can pass up 15 minutes worth of work
schoolwork anxiety how do you deal with it
i have always found just going outside into the woods in my backyard and doing my breathing exercises works wonders when i am starting to get dizzy and or hyperventilate what are some of yours
what are some of your safe places
four days ago i had my first panic attack i was at a friend s just watching tv when i started to notice my heartbeat rising for quite a while i tried to ignore it got fidgety went to the bathroom a few times and generally made excuses to pace around nothing helped eventually i went into blind panic my breathing went crazy ideas of heart attacks span around and around in my head i could not hide it from my friends any longer i stood up and told them how i felt grabbing one of them in a hug and telling them i thought i was going to die thankfully one of my friends had been through panic attacks before she recognised the situation and talked me down although it did take at least half an hour until i accepted that maybe i was not dying and started to slightly relax i say relax but it took over 12 hours before i felt remotely normal again i saw my doctor today he listened took my blood pressure and listened to my heart and lungs and reassured me that physically i seem ok which was a huge relief however he said that i was showing some signs of depression he did not offer me any drugs to help but i have been told a cbt therapist will be getting in touch at some point to arrange a meeting my main problem is what do i do in the meantime i cannot shake the feeling that another attack could happen at anytime i feel like i am constantly monitoring my own heartbeat and have to make a conscious effort to keep it anywhere near normal i have googled a few techniques to keep it in check but that still just feels like i am arming myself for a constant battle with my own mood is this normal how do you guys cope sorry if this is an over long post and i know similar things must have been posted before but any replies would be greatly appreciated thanks also sorry about the big blocks of text i normally hate reading them myself but i literally have no idea of where to break up a description of a panic attack edit did actually break it down a bit
got my first ever panic attack a few days ago and could use support
i started taking paxil after trying like six other types of medications from prozac to wellbutrin to remeron and several more last night i began taking the full dosage my psych has been slowly increasing the dosage to minimize side effects and i realized today that i am having a great day despite the fact that the day is nothing special and that in fact all has been well for a while now in short i think i might have finally found something that works for me so those of you feeling frustrated with the process of trying to help yourself do not give up it does get better
just wanted to submit a positive post this time my anxiety is almost completely under control at this point fingers crossed
my mind is my own tool i am not at it is mercy when the terror creeps up from my stomach coursing into my limbs and chest i allow it to pass through me like water through a tube i do not resist i do not desperately seek escape or relief the only way out is through i breathe i manually pick my thoughts up from the terrifying track they are running and place them on higher safer ground i keep them there like a hand put out to steady a wobbly toddler i run words of truth and calm through my head i breathe the past does not control me what ever happened last time and the time before that was then this is now i have more knowledge and skill than the last time this happened i choose to use those abilities now i feel discomfort that is all it is discomfort not death not insanity not crushing helplessness not disaster discomfort can be survived i breathe this will pass each time i undergo and then rally from this fear i have put one more solid tight fitting stone in the wall between me and this ever happening again i chose to turn away from this i say no you will not consume me tonight i can withstand you i control you not the other way around breathe
these touchstones have helped me when it is bad what are yours
i am going to guess that no two panic attacks are exactly the same for me it starts as a feeling of worry with no physical symptoms eventually i get a tightness or an empty feeling in my chest the best way i can describe it is the feeling you get when you see a gruesome injury or hear the words we need to talk i have got some bad news this feeling grows and grows and is the dominating feeling of the panic attack it is by far the worst thing i have ever experienced i feel like my heart is going to explode or stop completely or literally turn into a black hole and suck me in other symptoms are shortness of breath heart pounding shaking nausea and an uncontrollable urge to cry mentally i feel one of two ways either that i am about to die or that the panic attack will never end and i thus want to die after the panic attack i usually feel nauseous and depressed for the rest of the day or even for a few days after does anyone else experience panic attacks similarly or have a vastly different experience i have never talked to another person who has had a panic attack about how it feels so i really do not know what is normal
what does a panic attack feel like

hi r panicparty i made a comic for you hugs
first of all i am a 23 year old female i have always been a little neurotic and paranoid most of my life but most of the time that comes off as spunky hyper ness but now that i am getting older and i have the stress of real life i have been getting panicky and always during random times most of the time it is when i have nothing to do to keep my mind off of freaking out it all started with having this completely irrational fear of either having my appendix burst or a seizure so any time i felt a tad bloated or eat something that does not agree with me i get shaky and panicky and have to calm myself down and anytime i feel the slightest headache or funny feeling in my head even if it is not physically painful i start to feel numb shaky and panicky i thought i was just a hypochondriac but after googling any symptoms of some disease i thought i had i kept coming across anxiety attack sites sometimes i am scared to even calm down and go to sleep because i keep thinking something bad is going to happen to me that i need to address right now one of my worst attacks happened while i was watching tv with my boyfriend and then all of a sudden i started feeling funny and any noise i heard felt like a sensory overload almost i felt like i was going to go crazy after a few minutes of pacing around drinking water and talking with my bf i calmed down i have never passed out or anything yet because anytime i feel a panic attack coming on i rationalize myself through it i guess i just want to make sure this is in fact an anxiety disorder not some underlying life threatening disease that i actually have that i need to fear thanks for reading
my symptoms just wondering if other people can relate as well
i think this sub is a great place for people witn panic disorders who are seeking some advice i know that i have gotten great feedback from both those with the illness and actual therapists that being said i think this sub has room to improve i have not seen the moderator post in here so i am wondering if this was created and then abandoned or if he she still is around i have some thoughts for improving this sub which mostly deal with exposure getting listed on other mental disorder subs and such but am not sure how to go about it also it would be nice to have some relevant links in the sidebar to websites with the right kind of info people suffering from panic anxiety should know so i am wondering if any like minded people could offer suggestions of how we could improve this place and make it a stronger community with better resources i do not want to sound pompous but i had be interested in becoming a mod just because i am on here almost every day but do not know who i had talk to about that i think i will pm torvaldr edit i pm ed torvaldr and am waiting for a response at the moment keep bringing the ideas edit2 i am going to wait three or so days and then submit to redditrequest in case torvaldr does not get back to me edit3 i waited for a few days and never received a message back from torvaldr therefore i have sent a request to become a moderator of this sub hopefully everything pans out soon
is anyone interested in improving this sub

i cannot believe this place exists i am so grateful i was starting to think i was the only one dealing with this nightmare
anyone have any panic attack stories they want to share my first panic attack happened at work while i was driving a car i immediately pulled over and slammed on the breaks jumped out of the vehicle and stumbled to the ground i thought i was dying i had my friend co worker who was in the passenger seat drive me to a doctor one time i was on the metro and i had a panic attack when the train was going through a long tunnel i spent five minutes felt like an hour freaking out in the car pacing up and down the aisle trying not to break down before the train got to a stop i spent about 45 minutes at a random station pacing around and convulsing before i could bring myself to get back on the train and continue going to where i needed to be i was at a busy station but i have never felt more isolated in my life edit hey everyone thanks for sharing your experiences looking at the stories redditors have shared it is clear that just because people suffer from anxiety it does not mean they are incapable of demonstrating lots of gall which in my mind is a positive trait of survival you all rock hard thanks for your inspiration
where is the worst place you have had a panic attack
i get anxiety going on long trips going to work when someone else is in the washroom basicailly everytime i am in a situation where if i needed to take a shit it wouldent be the best moment to do so anyone else dealt with this how did you work through it i am having some success with accepting the anxiety and telling myself its just my body being foolish and to trying to just live with it but if someone else has more information i would love to hear it
anxiety makes me think i am going to have to shit at inopportune times

created the blog for anxiety sufferers written by those who have it tell me what you think
i am a web developer and really wanted to start a blog about something i have seen a few blogs out there about anxiety but most deal with treatments for it not about what happens when you have it would anyone be interested in something like this
would anyone be interested in a blog from someone who suffers anxiety about different anxiety panic related topics
i have read a lot of posts from people who suffer panic attacks and describe a symptom they think might be related i endured a full 11 years of anxiety before medication resolved it and thought i would share a list of the physical symptoms anxiety used to cause the spectrum of physical issues that stress can manifest in a person is incredible and the symptoms i experienced seemed to cycle change and randomly come and go since medication the following have thankfully been resolved spots in vision like a camera flash induced after image fuzzy vision like static when looking around in dim light or at dark objects long lasting after images and trails in vision numbness and tingling in extremities coldness in extremities night sweats blotchy pattern on hands due to constricted blood vessels a sense of being off balance or about to fall feeling as if about to pass out constant pounding heartbeat followed by panic when it was not felt upon relaxing fluttering heart palpitations thump feeling in chest muscle tension all over back and neck muscle twitches muscle spasms in neck that caused dizziness faint feeling difficulty breathing feeling breathing was not taking in enough air metallic taste in mouth exploding head syndrome yep it s feeling as though death was imminent and a total loss of control i will note that none of this was predictable with me save that the feeling of nearly passing out was very frequent on long drives these symptoms and panic attacks were mostly random unexpected and came out of no where which made it all the worse good luck to anyone that is going through similar work with your doctor keep close with family and friends you will find something that works for you and makes you feel normal again
a list of symptoms all the ways anxiety messed with me
i have been traveling and away from home so much that the loneliness has been soul crushing and once my thought process turns on me like that i start to obsess and over analyze everything i have convinced myself that i have copd or emphysema because of a cough i have had i have called off work because i was too tired and too frazzled to think about working i spent the entire shaking and hyperventilating and crying i keep wanting to go to the doctor but i know they are gonna scoff and tell me i am fine i feel trapped i cannot shake the feeling that i am terminally ill even though i know it is in my head it is just really difficult to shake once anxiety starts to manifest itself physically i need a way to calm myself down does anyone have any good tips
it is been a terrible week for anxiety for me does anyone have any good tips for calming themselves down
a little back story anxiety and depression run in my family but i never thought i had cause to worry about it because i lived 26 years without ever experiencing true anxiety or at least chronic anxiety i have had spells of depression but who hasn t nothing major but i will say the depression has kicked in a little more lately as i have been experiencing both depression and anxiety for the past 7ish months dna aside i feel my anxiety was brought on by a massively bad shroom trip that ended with me in the er ashamed and embarrassed i thought i was dying called an ambulance since that frightful day i have not smoked weed or eaten shrooms and i do not plan to ever again drugs are behind me forever even if i do somehow find a sure fire cure for this i do not even know why i made this post it just has a tendency to break you down and make you desperate for anything you know recently i moved back in with my family to save up for an engagement ring shortly after i got laid off from work so i have had ample time to sit around the house and think as most of you probably know all too well thinking can be torturous i wish i could just chill out ignore the churning stomach and continue my day calm and clear but i cannot i lost my medical insurance but recently applied for another plan if i get approved i am seeing a therapist asap what is ridiculous is my fear seemingly stems from nothing most of the time i just get scared of being scared and when i am not scared i get scared of the possibility of being scared it is a vicious cycle in which the fear fuels itself so i have been looking into meditation and soon to be dieting exercising also looking for a new job and looking to start college just trying to insert a lot of positivity into my life what have you guys found that helps
so i have joined the wonderful world of anxiety
i am so overwhelmed right now i am a 21 yr old female full time student and work as well i have been missing school and work because of this almost two weeks ago on friday night when trying to go to bed i had a panic attack i am not sure what triggered it but it freaked me out since then i have not been able to sleep for days or eat i will have random panic attacks triggered by monitoring myself i am full of anxiety pains and now this is leading to depression for fear that i will never get out of this now my obsession is on my breathing it was first only when i went to bed to try and sleep i would monitor my breathing to the point i got so anxious i could not sleep to the past few days i have been constantly monitoring my breathing all day long with a fear that if i stop controlling my breathing that it will stop all together i am desperate to get this out of my mind and i want to go back to living normally when i did not even notice my breathing i really would like to sleep and function normally again any advice
help panic attack has completely taken over my life
latest one for me just happened a while ago while i was driving before i had left my apartment i had taken an ibuprofen my head felt funny idk how to describe it each time i freak out my head does not hurt it just feels slightly funny or maybe i just think and focus too much on it anyways i started driving with the windows down and tried to convince myself to stop being crazy and that i was okay but then my heart beat got faster and then i convinced myself i was about to have a sensory overload seizure or black out at any moment so i took the nearest exit i always take out my phone in case i have to call someone or 911 or something ridiculous i calmed myself down enough to drive back home when i got here i felt a little drowsy and started semi freaking out again because i did not know why i felt tired and convinced myself i was going to black out again or something but i am now calm i hate this i feel like my brain is separate from me and just freaks out when it wants to every time i have to rationalize with myself that i am just crazy but okay how do ya lls start out is it always random and crazy like mine edit i have since been to my local towns clinic told the doctor about my anxiety and they prescribed me anti anxiety medicine i forget what it is called but it is wonderful it helps send serotonin to my brain no more panic attacks
how do your panic attacks usually start

was not sure where to put this but this seems like the best place anxiety rage true story
so i am surfing reddit trying to distract myself from my anxiety while the 2 xanax i just popped kick in and i find this place throwaway account but i thought i had just put this out there in case anyone is listening and just as an excercise in catharsis i have had anxiety panic problems for about 3 years regarding my health mainly regarding my heart lungs and chest oddly specific right my issues stem from a surgery i had when i was 19 to repair pectus which was ironically voluntary i had it done because of self image issues that i have now grown out of anyway i was laid up in the hospital for 2 weeks recovering during which my right lung collapsed if you have never had the pleasure of experiencing a pneumothorax its akin to slowly becoming unable to breath while each breath feels like someone is stabbing you with a pincer down from your shoulder into your lung by the time the dr s got in their to fix the problem i could barely breath 6 months of recouperation taking it easy out of the hospital and another 6 months of normal living occurred before i first started having symptoms of anxiety panic attacks at the time i was a heavy marijuana user and the attacks would only occur when i got high so i quit smoking cold turkey nearly immediately but a few months later they started to happen when i was sober for me my anxiety mostly manifests itself with thoughts that something is wrong with the area affected by the surgery i will be sure that my lung is collapsing again or that my chest wall sternum is collapsing back into me or that i am having a heart attack i started having these more frequently and it was debilitating almost once a night add to the fact that they usually occured at night and i was getting almost 0 sleep i eventually found a psychologist and he walked me through some excercises gave me a mild xanax perscription for emergencies and basically just let me talk it out with him this helped and after a while they started to go away its been nearly 2 years since i have had them with any sort of frequency but i just got hit with a real bad one tonight after having a few mild attacks earlier in the week its probably the stress of finals coming up but i am out of my mind worrying that i am going to go back to the way it was before i have moved across the country since i had them last and do not have a psychologist i can talk it out with over here anyways sorry for the rant i really just needed to vent
i thought my anxiety was gone but tonight it came back w a vengeance
is anyone else triggered by school and all that surrounds it it seems that anything having to do with school triggers at least mild anxiety in me at times it is gone to the point of absolute debilitating fear of anything school related a little background i am in my early 20s and trying to receive my bachelor s in communications i am good at what i do in terms of speaking writing and networking it comes naturally to me and always has however i have not had your typical college experience a few things both personal and out of my control have happened since i graduated high school back in 2004 causing me to sometimes delay working towards my bachelor s i enrolled at a private university immediately after high school but the cost ultimately drove me to transfer to a state college closer to home so i could commute after that problems at home both economic and otherwise caused me to work full time withdraw from semesters and take a semester off here and there once everything seemed to be going more smoothly i re enrolled and then had to move to another state in the middle of another semester causing me to delay this process even more however i always maintained the will to finish school and everywhere i moved i enrolled in school so as not to fall behind however now i am in the process of applying for colleges once again to complete my bachelor s most people i talk to sort of commend me for not giving up while the others i can sense are quite judgmental of my situation and do not understand what i have been through and how badly i am trying to overcome it i know that people go back to school every day even at 30 or 40 years old and i am nowhere near either but because it has taken me so long and there have been so many setbacks i am absolutely riddled with fear that something is going to happen to delay the process even more i know that this is irrational negative thinking that will get me nowhere but because of my history it seems only the natural pattern i also understand that my negative feelings toward the situation are only prolonging my fear and adding to my stress causing me to sometimes physically give up and panic uncontrollably there have been times that i have woken up early driven all the way to school prepared parked and have become so overcome with anxiety that i actually could not even get out of the car i have never told anyone this because i feel it is hard for people to understand but that is what i mean by debilitating it is the feeling of overwhelming stress and anxiety to the point where my body just does not move i cannot open the car door or leave i just sit there until the feeling passes sometimes i had walk in very late after sitting in the parking lot for so long or just drive away is it because school has become such a negative symbol in my life that i am actually sub conciously afraid of it if so how do i overcome this has this happened to anyone else it is so hard to understand because it is not laziness or lack of will it is bizarre to me and although it does not happen often when it does i become so angry with myself further propelling the anxiety cycle and for the record i used to be a straight a student and have an absolute love for school up until things started going awry in my family life and school became a source of anxiety it is almost like if i cannot do it perfectly i cannot do it at all if anyone has any input or tips on how to control this fear anxiety and panic please let me know tl dr school causes debilitating fear and panic sometimes help
iae triggered into panic because of school
i do not suffer from panic attacks but i do have bouts of elevated anxiety i am going through one right now and that fucking movie has left me with this overwhelming sense of dread i threw up this morning and i think it was partially a result of that anyone care to share similar stories
i watched eraserhead this weekend big mistake now my anxiety is through the roof what are some dumb things you have done to accidentally set yourself off
i suffer from periods of cyclical panic attacks where i basically am at 97 anxiety panic for hours or days at a time it is hard to sleep eat anything i am in one of these periods right now and it is perhaps the worst i have ever experienced in my 10 years of suffering with this i am on day six and the last five days have been pure hell the reason for this post is i am getting a bunch of weird symptoms that i do not usually have and they are just not only are they extremely distressing but it is freaking me out that i am dying or something and dismissing it as a panic attack i mean i know that is not the case i ve seen my doctors but i cannot stop worrying about it so in the name of making me feel less alone more normal has anyone ever experienced any of these symptoms during panic attacks or periods of really bad anxiety chills and a low grade fever only a degree or two high i am sure this is not a normal fever because taking anti pyretics asprin tylenol have done nothing for it and it only started with the onset of the cyclical attacks but it is making me feel horrible like i have the worst flu in the world i am hot then freezing then hot again my doctor said it was a stress fever but dsjk really severe body aches like i have been in a bar fight intermittent numbness of the face and arms to the point where i can bite pinch my skin hard and feel nothing really bad acid reflux and occasional barfing of bile stomach acid i also keep getting really hungry but after the first bite of food i feel like puking if anyone could offer some empathy or advice or anything that might help i would be eternally grateful 3333
having cyclical panic attacks does anyone else get chills and other weird symptoms x post from r anxiety
okay so for the last few years i have noticed something first of all my panic attacks really come randomly i usually do not get them that often maybe once every other month a big one will happen they usually leave me pretty much doing nothing the rest of the day with an on edge feeling nothing really triggers them other than the fact that they usually occur on days where i had bad or little sleep the night before and i wake up just feeling off however one symptom i have noticed is before i get a panic attack my legs specifically my calves feel shaky or weak it slowly gets a little and little more worse over the span of about 15 minutes then boom panic attack my heart and thoughts race for anywhere from a few to 10 or 15 minutes then i just feel physically exhausted and my legs and fingers shake for about 30 min to an hour after i hope this is anxiety does anyone else experience something similar i will be seeing a therapist starting the beginning of next month and i will tell them about this
anyone else have shaky legs before getting a panic attack
well kind of i have had panic attacks over medical stuff and sometimes over going crazy and for awhile they were a near daily affair before getting on an antidepressant now a lot of my anxiety was about suicide i felt hopeless and all but more than anything i was worried that i would one day kill myself it was hard telling the difference but i think it is more true that i was worried about killing myself more than i was actually suicidal i am also anxious that i will be depressed for a long time hearing about david foster wallace brings my day down i have not read his work but the idea of someone killing themselves once they are old and mature and not in any extenuating circumstance gets to me because i am worried that i will not ever be over this the panic attacks over this anxiety start with a thought and it snowballs the other panic attacks end after an hour or so but i will be literally writhing with anxiety for hours and can never really sleep well i just want to know if i am the only one
anxious about anxiety
on tuesday i had a panic attack it was a big one with ambulance and screaming i m dying it was also only the second big one i had first one happened 1 5 years ago on my birthday because i got really drunk and then smoked some ridiculously strong weed this time i did not drink did not smoke trees stopped after the first panic attack or anything else i was sick and was taking tamiflu and codeine cough syrup as prescribed it started with me getting mildly light headed and feeling suspicious as if something is about to go wrong i went to the kitchen to my wife and had few glasses of water and said that i was not feeling good at that point i was already freaking out and thinking that something terribly wrong is happening my fingers started getting numb and tingly which made me freak out even more so i ran into my son s room and fell on the floor thinking that i am dying my wife ran up to me and asked if i was ok i told her that i was not and that she should make a call the language i used by that point i was completely overtaken by sheer terror i was kneeling on the floor in my bathrobe rapidly breathing my hands going almost completely numb my wife opened the window so i crawled up to it and started taking deep breathes and desperately trying to collect my thoughts somewhere on the back of my mind there was a voice of reason telling me to look back at my first panic attack and realize that i was just having another one but the terror was too strong i thought about how much i loved my son and how it would be real shitty to die and leave my wife as a single pregnant mother each one of those thoughts only multiplied already unmanageable fear of death finally the ambulance came at that point i decided to try to get up and see if i can dance the attack off i walked into the ambulance shaking and dizzy but after getting all of the basic test done and relaxing a bit i refused further treatment and went home it is been 48 hours since it i went to work today and just got back home i am feeling emotionally drained and ashamed of putting my family through the stress and not recognizing what now seem like obvious signs of a panic attack i want to hide away from everyone i want to get together with someone i really trust drink a bottle of whiskey and talk my ass off about what happened to me at the same time i could not force myself to admit to a work buddy of mine that i need someone to talk to and hoped for him to figure it out on his own not really sure where i am going with this anymore but thank you for reading
had my second full scale panic attack on tuesday
i am haunted by the horrible fear of dying all the time i suffer from anxiety obviously and have had three major panic attacks in the last month three years ago i started having these thoughts what if something happens to me what if that strange thing i felt in my arm is a heart attack what if what if what if in the last three years i have had very good days and i do not think much of it but because of stress my anxiety levels reached the sky and i started having panic attacks again ever since the first panic attack about a month ago the fear came back and now i cannot get it out of my head i am wondering if i am crazy or if i am the only person that fears death all the time and relates everything to that fear i am even starting to think bullshit like what if i get all these fears because something is actually going to happen i am tired of always being perceptive about what goes on in my body i am waiting for every kind of sensation or little pain and immediately think it is something serious i am sick of it all so i decided to let it all out on this lovely subreddit and begin a new phase fearless i have to understand that it is all in my head and it cannot get out of it i am perfectly safe has any of you ever felt that kind of fear i apologise if my voc and grammar are not very good
constant fear of dying that ends today
hey panicparty today i woke up feeling like shit i was not having a stroke or on the verge of having a heart attack nor did my chest hurt i felt like i was burning up but that is because it was a warm day and the heater did not really need to be on i had a massive hangover and it was the first day of feeling like shit for the longest time where i was not concerned it is the first day of 2011 and i feel optimistic about things still gonna try and not drink and i want to run a lot more in the coming year still freak out about the little aches and pains but things are a lot better from where i stood 6 months ago 2010 was a year of panic attacks and anxiety but i think 2011 will make all of that a memory thanks for being my webmd and helping me get over my ills i feel like the only thing that could cause a panic attack now would be losing this subreddit
i was not dying today

scientists pinpoint source of anxiety in brain scan study for the first time new more effective treatments could be around the corner
so i spent the weekend with my mom camping in the woods that was an awesome time and no stress whatsoever other than the usual mother daughter clashing which i can deal with however on the way back i had a full on unbridled panic attack probably one of the worst of my life i ended up hyperventilating in the car and sobbing for hours i have a knee injury and upon getting home and realizing i could not stand being  i ran for about a mile that was pleasant i am still a bit twitchy and avoiding reflective surfaces like the plague my reflection usually sends me into a panic conniption fit just looking for some fellow panickers to send me long distance e hugs d
epic panic attack yesterday
it has not happened often and even my closest friends do not know but from my experience it probably just looks like i am a huge spaz or overly sensitive neither of which are true really i know i should not worry about this but inevitably i do so are you worried about it how do you deal with it has anyone had experience with it what do you say to your loved ones
iae ever worried ashamed of what people think if they know or have seen you in the midst of a panic attack
curious as to what your parents are like as i am positive my family influence has a huge impact on my anxiety issues i am an only child and my parents are very loving and very overprotective my dad is high strung yet pretty worry free my mom is the most anxious person i have ever met and it took me like 19 years to realize that she is sensitive depressed and extremely critical but at the same time she is also incredibly caring loving and smart i love my parents and even truly like them as people but they are also a huge source of anxiety for me mostly because i constantly feel guilty for not being exactly how they want me to be they have very specific expectations for almost everything you can think of from ways to put away the laundry to how i should behave in my career i have struggled to live my life for me not for them but i am still very far away from forgiving myself for it what about you are your parents worriers or do you worry about them often do they factor into your anxiety at all
what are your parents like

i wrote this a few years ago it is my guide to happiness and overcoming panic
for me its usually thinking about loneliness diseases my health or worrying about my family being okay when i cant get in touch with them what are some of yours
what are some of your triggers that will almost always start an attack for you
i am a psych major i have gad and suffer from severe panic attacks the tiniest feeling that something is off in the upper left part of my chest left arm or upper back is enough to have me curled up in a ball begging my husband to please call 911 if he is not around i will have the number dialed so all i have to do is just hit the send button last semester i had been finishing up some long term therapy for a sudden increase in panic attacks i had been doing really well and had not a full blown attack in weeks when i had been having them daily and sometimes several times in one day before the therapy anyway i have a class every morning with one of the coolest teachers i have ever had he has gad and suffers from panic attacks as well well the last week of school during lecture he is discussing a past panic attack of his he always thinks he is having a heart attack he gets the chest pain and everything in this situation he began to have an attack right as he walked in from work he had been stressed all day so he expected it he did some breathing exercises and was determined to get through it he then stepped into the shower and realized that his pain was not going away like a normal panic attack his mind was thinking heart attack and he was thinking to himself that he knew better and he was going to get through this and not fool himself he gets out of the shower gets dressed and his daughter comes in and sees him in a cold sweat clutching his chest she called 911 it turned out that he was really having a heart attack that time because of this he says he will always think he is having a heart attack which makes it likelier that he will because it gets him so worked up and that just creates a vicious cycle everyone in my class thought his story was hilarious i was absolutely mortified and had to leave the room as the thought of this happening to me brought on a panic attack i always think my panic attacks are heart attacks to this day it is hard to shake that how am i ever supposed to know whether or not to get emergency medical help

reddit i suffer from agoraphobia please help
so today i woke up this morning and i have been anxious ever since my heart rate is elevated my hands are clammy and i am just generally nervous every second i had a massive panic attack yesterday and i want to know if anyone else experiences this i have had days like this about 8 or 9 times since my anxiety started about 2 years ago does anyone else experience something like this i am very afraid that it is more than just anxiety i will be calm for maybe a few minutes but it will spring up again all throughout the day any help
day of constant anxiety
i am constantly worried about it it heightens whenever i read a story about someone my age having a brain tumor or some terminal or weird disease or cancer does anyone else think this i get my panic attacks most of the time at random and i am always worried there is something wrong with me
anyone else afraid they have cancer or some disease
realizing all of this has been a crazy journey after my son was born i began really losing it worrying constantly about almost nothing at all and most especially things completely out of my control i went to see someone and after only two therapy sessions my eyes were opened to having dealt with generalized anxiety disorder my whole life i just learned to cope and deal with it really well so well in fact my mom never knew my wife of six years never knew and i never realized it was as bad as it was i thought everyone else lived the same way and therefore never thought this may be something i should not have to deal with i now have an appointment with the psychiatrist next week and am really nervous about taking medication my therapist says that after living my life this way for so long finding the right medication for me could make me feel better and more at ease than i ever have this honestly scares me i feel i always need control over myself and situations that could arise to harm me or my family i guess my biggest fear is that i will lose that control i am sorry for the long post i am just a little scared and this changes everything for me while explaining so much i am hoping there may be some words of wisdom from someone who has been there before
i was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder yesterday
after almost 4 years panic free with manageable anxiety last night i had an anxiety attack i woke up from a bad nightmare and trying to get back to sleep did not work the fear and dread lingered i awakened my partner and he tried to soothe me suddenly i found myself pacing around the living room hyperventilating and trying to get a grip through wave after wave of fear the whole time some part of my mind was thinking i remember this the tight chest short breath the feeling that i will never be happy again this is a panic attack
i am back to the panic party

deal with it is not advice
that was terrifying i have had a really really bad day and a generally crappy year lots of different stuff going on that has been causing me quite some stress i do have problems dealing with anxiety as i tend to bottle everything up and ignore my feelings i have never had a panic attack before now though it is nearly 3am as i am writing this an hour ago i was lying in bed with my so sleeping next to me my body was incredibly tense and i was attempting to deliberately loosen and relax my muscles to little avail my legs begin to twitch and then i started to have little periodic convulsions which is fairly normal for me it s a kind of way to release tension through a sudden sharp movement but these were entirely out of my control i then noticed i could distinctly hear my heart thud thud thuding in my ears and could feel the blood vessels in my neck throb to each beat i am a pretty analytical person so my first though was is this a panic attack what could be causing it i tried to slow down my heart and relax my body but it just made everything worse and my heart to pound harder then i suddenly noticed i could not breathe anymore i was gasping for breath unable to get enough oxygen that my lungs apparently needed i suppose it was a drowning sensation my body took over and i began to hyperventilate it was terrifying most of my logical brain knew that this was probably a panic attack and that they are fairly common and not threatening but then a small but very loud and insistent part of my brain was screaming that this was a heart attack and that i was going to die these two opposing thoughts apparently caused my body to become paralyzed i could not move or say anything but i was acutely aware that every muscle i had was tensed up and in a flight fight mode and that my lungs were telling me that i was not getting enough air and that something was seriously wrong all i could hear was the pounding in my head and it took all my willpower to keep the sane and logical part from being totally swamped by fear eventually the symptoms began to get less and over about ten minutes i began to slowly relax my heart is still beating a little above normal and every time i think back to it i quickly begin to feel closed in and a sense of dread i have never had anything approaching this before and yet i have had to deal with a lot of stress over my life i would not have thought that the events of the past week would illicit such an awful reaction now i am just scared it will happen again
i am pretty sure i just had my first panic attack
this subject has probably been brought up many times before but i would like a personal opinion i am 20 i have been suffering from panic attacks and general anxiety for all my life it is only had a negative impact for the last 4 years it used to happen only in school and then i ended up dropping out of high school my senior year because of it went back and finished with a diploma it has been getting progressively worse and two months ago i was forced to quit my part time job i have had for 3 1 2 years because i kept having panic attacks there i have been to therapy before and that helped a little i can control my anxiety attacks better i have also been on two different medications prozac and paxil and neither helped paxil made me more anxious i have panic attacks about twice a month and when they hit they are pretty bad the time in between them is spent constantly worrying about having another panic attack i am in a constant state of stress i am becoming agoraphobic and it is preventing me from hanging out with friends doing stuff i used to love taking even minute risks and having a successful relationship i have smoked pot a couple times before and it is seemed to help drastically but a couple weeks after i smoke i get a panic attack this probably seems like i am tying two separate events together and maybe am being a pit paranoid my question do you think that smoking cannabis every once in a while in moderation of course could help with my anxiety i am not looking for a long term treatment i know eventually i will grow out of it like the rest of my family who has dealt with this i just need something to help me get out there find a new job enjoy time with my friends and just enjoy life without fearing and being anxious literally every second i am awake edit i also get really bad stomach pains when i am anxious so i usually eat a couple tums every other day my appetite is not usually great either because of this
anxiety and cannabis your opinion
for me i really think i drive ok but panic or fear prevents me from driving my way to a place and use the bus instead i cannot help but feel anxious while driving in heavy trafifc or while overtaking
how do you overcome anxiety about driving
that is me right now worst thing ever i have to be up in less than 5 hours from now and i do not know what to do i have already gone a night with almost no sleep do i do it again anyone want to chat for a little bit
anyone ever have trouble sleeping from anxiety caused by not sleeping
anyone else stuck in this loop
anticipatory anxiety the fear of having a panic attack causes a panic attack
i think the title pretty much says it all i often find myself sitting up all night because i am simply too afraid to fall asleep i think my biggest fear is that i will die in my sleep i have tried everything that i can think of i cannot seem to just calm my mind i have cut out caffeine before bedtime i have tried reading to distract myself before bed but as soon as my head hits the pillow i become aware of my heart and just how fast it is beating and then i instantly go into panic mode and my thoughts are flooded with is this normal did it just skip a beat is my arm numb and i cannot calm down i will have a full scale panic attack and sleeping at that point is impossible i want to doubt that i am alone in this and ask does anyone have any advice
too afraid to sleep
i figured i could look around this subreddit page but i felt i wanted to just explain and see if anyone has specific pieces of advice two days in a row i have had anxiety attacks in the middle of school symptoms included troubled breathing strong pumping heart pounding headache and the most key sign breaking into tears these have most likely been due to mostly school related stress one occurred while doing a fast paced active assignment the other during study hall and before the next class when i was doing nothing the second one made me question exactly what might be setting it off though it seems to be general stress build up releasing any and all advice and comments would be of help since this is at the moment taking over my life
in need of some direct advice
my best friend and i both have anxiety disorders and comparing them often helps us understand each other so how would you describe your experience with your disorder or just anxiety in general i have both generalized anxiety disorder and obsessive compulsive disorder and it is an interesting mix the most prominent manifestation of my ocd is checking and re checking i can get into an almost endless cycle of checking the most mundane thing if i am not aware with gad i usually react to triggers but occasionally i will just have an overbearing sense of dread throughout the day i can often recognize when i am being severely affected by one or the other and make an attempt to adjust
what are your disorders like
just found this subreddit and wish i wouldve known this existed 4 years ago i felt obligated to talk about my experience and my way to cope with the panicparty i experience still just about every day to make a long story short i went on a binge drinking spree when i was 20 woke up smoked half a pack of cigs 2 cups of coffee 4 asprin and a bowl of weed before heading to work after about 3 hours of sleeo completely lost my mind waiting to take a delivery to a doctors office obgyn to be specific got to the office collapsed in the reception room woke up to nurses giving me water they thought i was dehydrated bp was 200 140 spent the next 2 months in my room only leaving to see doctors who thought i had diabeetus also spent that time on webmd diagnosing myself being a hypochondriac is just part of the ride with this disorder this was the worst idea ever i convinced myself i had cancer aids chrons vertigo diabetes etc do not do this finally made it to my parents house and saw my doctor diagnosed agoraphobic and having a panic disorder finally after 4 months of no answers i did not even know this existed people with depression and anxiety always seemed weak to me now i was neck deep in it and not questioning these disorders ever again i quit my job dropped out of school they let me back in lost a gf who also took me back lost 40 pounds because i refused to eat anything lest it make me feel any worse then the best thing that could happen to me did i met a guy at the same bar that started all this who suffered and he knew immediately what was wrong 4 years later i still consider myself a sufferer i have at least 1 minor attack a day usually triggered by something i would assume is like vertigo example ever sat in a car in park and seen a car reversing very slowly and it gives the illusion that youre going forward those sorts of things trigger me bad the biggest trigger is being hungover which is not suprising because i associate with the first big attack i had those big attacks every day for 4 months since then i havnt had ever felt the need to freak out i would just like to point out some things that really worked for me and things that didnt things that didnt work for me 1 quitting smoking cigs weed caffeine alcohol all at the same time this is a recipe for nervous system disaster if you feel like you are lifestyle is worsening your attacks ween them out 1 at a time 2 zoloft xanax was put on both never took the xanax hypochondria and the zoloft made me freak out and made it worse things that worked 1 finding natural ways to lower bp i have naturally high bp and i am positive it directly influences my attacks i did stop drinking caffeine for a long time back on it now and no probs here 2 exercise helped me get past the first few months i stopped regularly exercising since but it definately helps 3 do not change your lifestlye 180degrees in a day its stressful on your mind and body it will not help gradually move into a direction you want you life to go there is probably more but this is getting too long i can honestly say and i know a lot of people wont agree and maybe hate me for saying it that these attacks have made me a much better person i still have panic attacks but i am impressed with my own focus in curbing them its almost exhilerating i dont challenge my body but i also dont let anxiety take over you can not die from anxiety alone this can not be stressed enough talk to family likeminded people or reddit and understand that your attacks will be short if you make them so i hope this helps some people remember this is my experience and techniques at dealing with it i am not dissing drugs or anyone elses treatment options this worked for me and i am proud of myself for being able to say i am a better person because of it i have accepted this will never ever go away completely and i am ok with that i will be around for a while if anyone wants to ask any specifics or just wants to rant tl dr i have had panic attacks for 4 years i dont feel healed but i feel good about whats happening
my panic adventures hopefully someone can relate and feel even a little better
i am a 30 year old male who had my first panic attack about 3 years ago it broke me i have never been the same since i started seeing a psychiatrist immediately and was put on clonazepam i was prescribed to take 3 5mg daily i took between 2 and 3 pills a day i was still anxious all the time but never had full blown panic attacks i quickly developed a dependency to the drugs i started to ween myself off of them after about a year and felt better i was exercising and working full time without much of a problem i was still anxious most of the time today i feel better i take about a quarter of a 5mg clonazepam when i start to feel anxious and it evens me out i probably average about 1 pill monthly the problem is that i am still not right i still cannot accept that is something that i will just have to live with has anyone completely gone back to their former self i feel tremendously better than i did 3 years ago but it is still there it is still always in my mind
learning to live without panic attacks
i woke up this morning from a horrible anxiety nightmare and have been keyed up all day i did not sleep well last night and have not for the past week i recently moved to a new area and started a new job and there is been a lot of pressure for me to deliver here in a very short amount of time with not many resources available to me at the moment i have just been going a mile a minute and know i am going to hit a wall any time now my heart has been racing all day and feel like i am speed or something not that i really know anything about that but what i imagine speed to be like anyone know how i can just calm down and get back to center right now it is just been a bad week for me
really struggling today
i have agoraphobia to the point where i can barely leave the house hypochondria that is so bad i have constant panic attacks and severe dp dr i do not know how to cope i am going to therapy twice a week and it just is not helping i am so terrified of dying or getting sick it is taking over my life it is my every fucking thought i do not know how much more i can take before i lose my fucking mind i do not know what to do anymore i keep trying to convince myself i am gonna live to be old and have a happy life but i just do not see it i just know i am gonna die of some awful disease the paranoia is consuming me i just need someone to talk me through this
i cannot fucking take it
i will try to keep this short as there is so much to type about what i am going through i am a male in his late 20 s i have had an issue with vomiting since i was 10 years old i remember feeling ill one day during class and asking to go to the nurse s office when i had arrived the door was locked i remember going into the fetal position and crying at this point when the nurse finally arrived i was sent home the following day of school i had the same nauseous feeling this time the nurse had me lay down and then go back to class after a few days of the same symptoms i was not allowed to go to the nurses office anymore that is when i stopped eating to not feel ill at school this issue was only at school at first but by high school it had began to creep into every aspect of my life social family personal etc when i started working at 16 i would not eat until i got home from school work and that would be around 9pm this is also around the time when i first started approaching my parents about my problem through my parents insurance they paired me with a psychiatrist and started me on anti depressants due to my fear of vomiting being so large i could only take medicine at night i went through maybe 10 or so medicines before they told me that this is something that i just have to live with at 19 i was able to get a job with decent health care kaiser permanente initially started me with strictly meds but after a few sessions of practically begging for help they set me up with a cbt therapist the sessions generally would last an hour and would be once a week i would mention the trouble i had eating and how it was destroying my life they told me that i have an anxiety disorder and that eating was not the issue i felt like i was going insane when i had 3 different therapists tell me this 7 years later at 26 i still have the same job and i am still not eating at work my weight never went above 115 during this whole period and i am around 5 7 i looked like i was 12 13 years old i do not even want to get started about the ridicule you experience being a rail thin male with no meat on their bones during this time i also managed to get to my senior year at a university but i would do what i did in high school not eat until i got home from everything 9pm or so one night of having what felt like non stop panic for 3 days i checked myself into an er i told them that i had not eaten in 2 days and that i cannot with my phobia and that i was so afraid the nurse left and next thing i knew i was being strapped down to a gurney and they stuck me on a 51 50 this was probably one of the most traumatizing experiences of my life they initially stuck me in a room with a guy who was punching the wall all night i begged the nurse that they made a mistake and they told me to wait until morning i never felt so afraid for my life in the morning they finally told me they made a mistake and stuck me in a more secured environment before the 72 hours they ended up releasing me saying that i had no place there after this experience something strange happened within my body i do not know if it was from all the shock but when i went back to work 2 days later i saw a bagel on the counter and picked it up and ate it i felt nothing no anxiety nothing all of the sudden i was eating breakfast lunch dinner i was being social i started socially drinking too never did due to my fear it felt like something just clicked and i was fixed i was not taking any meds it was the strangest thing my weight went to 160lbs and it felt incredible and i know that there is no normal but for 1 year i felt normal it was great in 2011 i was laid off of my job with a bunch of people and this is when everything started going down hill i really cannot even recall a specific point of when things started to turn in relation to the eating but being laid off definitely kicked my anxiety back into full gear i ended up just sitting at home not eating laying in bed for hours my weight went back down to 120lbs and i ended up moving back home this was terrible since even eating around my parents is difficult with this phobia my father would get angry when i would not eat around them and it just magnified the problem after a few months i finally landed another job and moved back out with a friend after a year of not eating at work i decided to seek help again i found a place that does act therapy and exposures with eating food i initially started going going after work but it was deemed unsafe since i was not able to eat at this place i was not getting enough food so they pulled me off of work with fmla it is been 6 months since that and i have since gone back to work part time i still struggle with my panic attacks and my exposures are absolute nightmares i am on one anti depressant currently that actually worked great the first 2 months but now it feels like i am not taking anything i have had panic attacks for the last 3 days that have felt non stop i was recommended last week by my therapist to write during my panic episodes i ended up writing 22 pages of the darkest thoughts i have ever had i know this is long winded and i am sorry for all grammar errors but i really do not know where else to turn to i am ashamed to talk to family and friends because they have always been there for me and have backed me 100 getting help but when i have constant panic attacks all the time i feel like i am failing them it is tough to tell them how i am really doing thank you for anyone who took the time to read this

we have been a subreddit for nearly a year now and have grown so much in that time we are going to make some improvements in the coming weeks and we had like to have your input on what you think should be included every reasonable request will be considered i think we can easily boost readership over 1000 in the coming weeks months with the help of our newest moderator some things taken from the post linked will be included if you have any recommendations please post it here or message me or  some things we will definitely be including linking other stress anxiety panic disorder subreddits on the right panel linking to third party anxiety help literature designating counselors that can be on call similar to what goes on over in suicide instituting flair i think since we have the resources to do this easily we might as well however at this point there is no definite plan to do so if you have any ideas we had love to hear them compiling lists of calm down tips techniques and ways to live a functional healthy life with panic disorder expanding the subreddit description holding a competition to decide the new banner photo found at the top left hand corner cheers everyone stay safe healthy and calm
hi guys we are going to be making some awesome changes around here that we are all super excited about in addition i had like you all to welcome our newest moderator to the panicparty family
looking for others who have been dealing with anxiety depression panic attacks for support and reassurance that i am not alone in this would love to share stories and advice with people who are going through what i am going through i have been dealing with this for 2 years now and it came on out of the blue until just recently i have been very difficult to convince that it is just stress but after seeing a neurologist cardiologist internist opthalmologist having numerous negative test results and doing tons of research on my own i guess i need to accept that it is all in my head it is difficult because i have always considered myself someone who handles stress very well i avoid drama tackle problems logically rationally and i have never been one to sweat the small stuff looking for anyone who would be interested in sharing their experiences i am a 27 yr old woman if that matters to anyone i will not get into all my crazy symptoms just yet because i could go on forever feel free to message me privately if you prefer i could really use someone to talk to and i am also a great listener
suffering from general anxiety disorder could use some reddit support
has anyone else been prescribed remeron for gad i have tried prozac wellbutrin zoloft and then lexapro all of which caused various side effects now without seeing me my psychiatrist who does not listen to me so i am trying to replace her has switched me to remeron a drug commonly prescribed for insomnia and or depression which i do not have just looking for stories from anyone who has experience with remeron or even anyone who knows someone who does
remeron for generalized anxiety disorder feeling very nervous about this
i feel like i am becoming a hypocondriac or maybe it is a part of me that still believes my anxiety and panic attacks are something physically wrong with me however i always freak out at the slightest bump the slightest cough the slightest ache and blow them out of proportion what if i have cancer am i going to die am i going to get really sick i cannot afford getting sick does this mean therapy will not work etc all these thoughts run through my head and damn i know it is not positive does anyone else experience this
does anyone else over examine parts of their body and freak out at the slightest thing
i have been suffering for almost a month now from fairly regular panic attacks and my job has not really permitted me the time to seek help i hope to soon is there anything safe and otc herbal that works that will help
is there anything you guys use to calm down that is not prescription strength
not because i feel like i am capable of such an act but it almost drives me into panic mode thinking of the scope of human mental illness this is one of my triggers and all day today i have been reading about how this kid used to seem normal till he took a delusion turn in his late adolescence am i the only one that gets freaked out by the bizarrely large spectrum of mental illness also the media s response to this disaster has me in a frenzy but that is another story
dae get really freaked out when public displays of mental illness ie the giffords shooting seem to imply this could happen to anyone
and it is beginning to cripple me emotionally i cannot trust my body and i cannot trust my thoughts i know i should see someone but where do i start what if i have a real condition that is causing me to get these symptoms i had a blood test done at the free clinic but they said my blood is fine slightly elevated cholesterol had three ekgs since the priz angi and they are all negative anyone have similar story or advice not sure where to turn i can not get do not have insurance i do not have a lot of money
i have been getting panic attacks for ten years a heart attack prinzemetals angina four years ago has not helped the situation have never spoken with a psychiatrist about them have never been on medication long term they are happening on a daily basis now
i really do not feel like typing out my entire story again so i hope you do not mind the links to askreddit they pointed me in this direction basically i have had panic attacks and anxiety for about two years now i get really bad panic attacks once every couple months had a bad one two days ago still recovering also i am trying to figure out what to do to help my anxiety and panic attacks i would like to avoid medication if possible and from what i have seen in my family members who suffer from this they peaked around their late teens early twenties after which it dwindled down post on askreddit about my

three days with physical anxiety symptoms
do you think it is possible once you have had the experience of a panic attack to never be afraid of having one again i want to believe that can be true but unfortunately for me it is still not background i am a 22 year old who has had moderate to severe anxiety since infancy great subreddit btw
is it possible
it all started when i was in high school i have always been a bit nervous as a young boy i had severe social anxiety and hypochondria i went on medication when i was 15 until i was 17 it made the attacks stop but it made me severely depressed as a side effect my sex drive was non existent and my girlfriend at the time left me because i was a zombie it was then i realized medication was not for me i have adopted more eastern medicinal practices such as diet meditation and increased my exercise to help balance me out its been working quite well but this semester at school has been extra stressful so the attacks have been returning basically i just want someone to hear me out and maybe put in their two cents is there anyone out there who has also refused medication to take care of their problem on their own what have you substituted it with to help with the anxiety
i am a 22 year old male with generalized anxiety disorder and suffer from crippling panic attacks i have refused medication
i have a lot of bullshit going on in my life this semester has been absolute hell i had a presentation to do in class today could not make it into the building without hyperventilating i am running out of xanax and i am running out of time to make things right again next week is finals week and i do not know if i am going to be able to handle it so i am just laying in bed with a racing heart wondering how fucked i am there was no way i was going in that classroom when i could barely breathe and keep myself from having a breakdown to be honest i do not know what i expect to gain from sharing this but i need to vent to someone who understands what panicing really means
starting to choke school is becoming too much to handle
a cup of coffee and some breakfast later i find my blood trying to crawl out of my arms full on panic party of one over here ativan is not doing the trick and i am too tired from my busy week to exercise the feeling off
anxiety out of nowhere
hey panicparty i am new here and thought i had introduce myself by sharing my all time favorite panic attack last september i was riding a 20 hour train from new jersey to illinois to visit my boyfriend when the unaccountability of riding on a train alone started to get to me by the morning i had lost all the sensation in my body even my dear lady parts it did not come back for a week and i am not ticklish anymore in the next few weeks i had some minor panic attacks worrying about possibly having a similar panic attack again i had love to know if anyone s experienced anything similar or if there is anything else someone would like to share i was diagnosed with severe anxiety and ocd in april so i am finally getting good at all this
panic attack to end all panic attacks
i recently discovered this subreddit i cannot tell you how much it is helped me to read about all of you who have the same experiences as i do i do not know anyone around my town with any anxiety issues my family does not have a big history of it and frankly my husband cannot understand what i go through it is been really trying on our marriage things are looking up here in these past few months as i have really been breaking my neck trying to work on what i can and he is been working on what he can to understand my panic attacks our biggest issue is that he just cannot relate to that feeling of just knowing that you are going to die for whatever reason and the immediate regret and depression when the panic swell has passed i cried happy tears out of the relief that there are other people here that i can get help from and help out this subreddit is a lifesaver
hello panic party
i know that you are not doctors but i just want to know if i am going to die if i take some tomorrow if i need it my anxiety is bad right now i had a terrible panic attack today and i know i might flip out tomorrow so i am just wondering if i could take an ativan if it really came down to it
ran out of prescription for klonopin and forgot to pick up the new script before xmas is it safe to take ativan my sister in law has some in case of a panic attack need advice please
the literature on panic i read keeps saying one of the ways to calm yourself is to examine what s the worst that could happen that is a good question for me a panic attack is the worst thing that i will be absolutely consumed in fear and pain that my bowels will cramp i will feel faint i will be unable to do anything but spend months on my couch rocking myself and there will be no help for me what do you fear what is the worst that can happen
so for you what is the worst that could happen
so i post a decent amount on this subreddit i have been dealing with pretty bad anxiety and panic attacks for around 4 years i really thought that they came out of nowhere in my senior year of high school then they got really bad the summer after at home i thought that is where it all started i got to thinking the other night just about my past and there were a lot of clues that i never really put together that i could use an opinion on for instance from the age of 4 to around 9 or 10 years old i had to sleep in my parents room i would absolutely refuse to sleep alone in my room why at 4 i watched this show on tv that was talking about a celebrity who was shot and killed while sleeping from an intruder i do not know why but i started having absolutely horrible fears of people breaking into my house and killing me in my sleep i could not be in my room because of it i would kick and scream and cry until finally my parents gave in could this have been the start of everything or just me wanting to believe so i also got massive stomach aches whenever i would go out of town with my dad when i was younger i just played it off as not feeling well but when i would come home i had be fine eventually i just stopped leaving because i knew i would have a stomach ache and i would anticipate it before even leaving
could i have shown anxiety at a young age
i am a panic disorder and gad sufferer for around the last 3 or so years i am currently not on any medication and my anxiety comes and goes some days i will feel fine while others i feel like complete garbage for the last 2 days my anxiety has been through the roof i am naseous i feel groggy as hell my nose and eyes are itchy i get a headache here and there and my heart rate is fast here and there as well as me getting sweaty palms i have come to realize that my anxiety peaks at very predictable times of the year i first started having my bad anxiety attacks around june 20th of 2009 i had another bad episode last year around july 2nd now i am having it again at nearly the same time i also have bad allergies to grass and weed pollen which according to the weather channel just started to peak in my area my dad has really bad allergies to the stuff as well and it is a pretty miserable time i never thought that both could be connected i am not saying that pollen is causing my anxiety but is there a possibility that it is aggravating it beyond normal levels anyone else experiencing something like this and what could help it all started after i went on a bike ride around my neighborhood outside for around an hour since then i have felt like garbage when i go outside
allergies and anxiety gad
it all started here now the anxious mind is like an undisciplined child if you decide she needs to go to bed at 8pm after years of letting her stay awake and do whatever she wanted she will not like it it will be weeks of reinforcement and difficulty but in the end she will obey so with our minds the stimulus comes for panic tiny almost invisible a smell a memory a question you mind recognizes the fear and begins to charge down a path with which it is most familiar where there is least resistance panic you cannot control what jumps into your head but it is up to you whether or not it dances there i will step in front of my mind as it barrells down the path toward familiar pain i will stop gently i will remove it and place it where it needs to be instead no need to dwell on how horrible it was last year do not poke your wound instead the sun it turns my skin a rich tan and fuels my garden the heat allows my little ones to splash in a wading pool and create happy summer memories the smell of grass is a lush lawn to stretch out on and the pain of last year i had to go through it to get my jack the fat sweet thing next to me that was then this is now my mind is my own tool i control it not the other way around i breathe
so what am i gonna do about it
my wife has had anxiety issues for over a year now and they seem to be getting worse she has several panic attacks a month she has been talking about finding a therapist for several months now and has done some research on some however she feels a great deal of anxiety about finding the right one and figuring out the logistics she also wants to start exercising as she has heard that can improve anxiety however she hasn t and continues to beat herself up about that talking about her anxiety can give her panic attacks as well she has asked me to help her figure out what to do as she has not been able to take control of this as she does with other things my question is what can i do to help how can i best help any advice you have on what i can do
wife with anxiety how can i help
i started taking zoloft yesterday for my panic anxiety disorder and i have been experiencing weird sensations in my body which as an extremely anxious person is very unnerving my sight feels trembly and i cannot focus well my head starts spinning when i walk i feel as if i weighed a thousand pounds and i feel very weak i also feel very trembly is it normal has anyone experienced similar effects and did the zoloft help you
experiences with zoloft
what do you guys think of the idea that us as humans have the ability to delve into innate skillsets and that fear is just one of them someone who delves into fear will be skilled at experiencing it they will experience anxiety be experts in panic or fight flight someone who delves into music will be skilled in that if we learn to delve into other areas of live in the same way perhaps we can crawl our way out of the black hole of anxiety
fear expertise and the illusion that fear is what we are best at

you really should be working on that big essay that is due friday
what the fuck am i so afraid of
i sat in a room with two girls last night for around 45 minutes and said not one word
i considered making a fake account for this but what the hell long and short of it is i work two jobs neither are really stressful except that before i had these two jobs i had one and it was a nightmare because a harassment issue got the owner s son fired he harassed me calling me gay faggot etc in front of coworkers and customers often and now i suffer from stomach uneasiness as i go to work it is not pain it is not painful and it does not make me want to throw up so it is not making me nauseous i m a bit of a hypochondriac constantly analyzing my symptoms and whatnot it helps when i look at a huge list of symptoms for things and notice that i do not have a physical disease it just wrenches and gurgles in my stomach when i think of all the terrible things it could do to my body and health it makes me worry more how can i beat this i am in between health coverage right now and i am afraid of the cost of counselling and such any good at home remedies
i frequently suffer from anxiety related uneasiness in my stomach i do not know what to do
i have procrastinated through my good days and bad days in hopes that my anxiety and bad panic attacks will get better i keep getting called a hypocondriac and at 20 years old i already have pattern baldness do not know if this is from the stress or family but it is terrible looking either way i have been putting off seeing a doctor or a therapist for a few years i have never really been on medication long term for this but it is effected me a lot i have had to drop out of school early got my diploma though cannot apply for college lost my job etc i spend most of my days playing minecraft or other computer games to distract myself i am getting more bad days closer together and good days further apart i have tried to start my own business and get another job but could not go through with it because of my anxiety i know it is stupid to ask and the rational person would get help but i cannot help but feel pushed away from it i feel like i will be missing out on something if i go on medication or i could get worse i also do not have health insurance so i will be going to a walk in clinic i am going back to a therapist though and having it paid for but that is not til the end of next month i am debating going to the walk in clinic tomorrow as i feel like this is getting worse can i get some advice guys
anyone else fear getting help or getting on medication

25 stories of panic attacks and living with anxiety
my doctor keeps suggesting different medication for my anxiety but i am sick of being on pills he put me on xanax at 14 but i stopped taking it not long after my doctor recently put me on paxil at 17 which i had a bad experience with and am now off of it i do not want to take medication like this anymore afraid of it making me feel like crap becoming dependent on it or having bad withdrawals from it so my question is is there any kind of natural medicines that i could buy locally that seem to help with anxiety
any suggestions on natural medicines for anxiety
i have been battling gad for about 2 years now and have taken many different medications my gp prescribed ssri s at first zoloft lexapro and presiq i really hated taking them awful side effects including increased anxiety sexual problems brain zaps etc after about a year of taking these drugs my gp referred me to a psychiatrist the first thing my new pdoc wanted me to be on was prozac he explained that prozac is the best at treating gad due to its long half life i told him about the awful side effects from the other ssri s so instead of prozac he put me on buspar it worked for awhile and was for the most part side effect free but over time i had to constantly increase the dose was taking up to 90mg a day with little benefit my pdoc again wanted to put me on prozac which i again told him about my past experiences with ssri s so he put me on klonopin 1mg a day and all was well for well over 5 months with no side effects today was my 3 month check up and i was telling him that my anxiety has been getting increasingly worse he once again asked about my ssri past which i told him again instead of increasing the dose of klonopin which i figured he would do he insisted we tried prozac i made it clear to him about my feelings on ssri s but he said not to worry it will work he prescribed me 20mg to start and said that he will probably increase the dose to 40mg after a couple of weeks anyways sorry for the long rant i am now taking prozac and was wondering if any of you are taking it and how it makes you feel is prozac really a miracle drug for gad like my pdoc seems to think and should i expect the same nasty side effects as i have with zoloft and lexapro tl dr my psych put me on prozac for gad how does it work for you all who are currently taking it
what are your thoughts on prozac fluoxetine
it is the way the air smells in spring the way the sunlight hits the road outside my house the sound of the lawnmowers in the distance the heat coming on last year is coming back i spent a spring and summer prostrate with panic that chewed me up every day i was also pregnant and could not take medication to mediate the pain so every day it came i laid on my brown couch curled up i shook my left leg to rock myself for hours i lost so much weight when i was supposed to be gaining there was no escape no safe place no help for me fall came i took medication when my first trimester ended but not nearly as much as i thought i needed things got better manageable the baby came and i loved him the panic faded to ghosts and now here it is again despite the medication sitting on my lawn stinking of cut grass disgusting bird song sickly acid yellow sunlight i cannot eat my bowels will not hold together and stomach hurts from the acid churning in it i am so scared that is the bad part i am going to make another post with the good part the plan the truth
first catharsis in honesty to people who get it
i fucking hate google let me start off with that i fucking hate google because i will google the craziest shit in the world because it happened to me and is something i have not noticed this is about to get kinda graphic sorry for example just now i googled dark stool seeing as i just had a rather interesting excursion it did not hurt it was actually quite relieving but it was oddly dark so i decided hah would not it be a lark to google this and see what the cause of it is big mistake google flipped through some pages thoughtfully and said welp it could be that there is too much sodium and not enough veggies in your diet given that i am a heavy salt user and the only veggies i normally eat are potatoes and lettuce or black tar like stool could be a symptom of internal bleeding caused by an ulcer hey you have stress issues at work right maybe this is why your stomach hurt in brief stressful periods these past couple of days hmm maybe that right at which point i felt a familiar cold tingling enter my extremities fear god stupid fucking fear then fast breathing and suddenly my eyes felt frantic like they were going to bug out of my head i had to focus and breathe deep to calm myself down and remind myself that it is more than likely the cause of my poor diet and that my stool was not black and tarry it was just dark brown end gross stuff here i am still trembling and the doctor isnt a possibility i know logically that i am fine all signs point to it and yet the possibility feels as real as a car barreling towards me tl dr googled half symptom got full panic over what is probably nothing god i hate how my brain works
trying to avoid a relapse into serious anxiety and panic please help
doctors have diagnosed me with anxiety and i find that trying to search for similar symptoms can be futile many people have panic attacks and anxiety symptoms but they can sometimes be totally different from what i am experiencing i thought creating a post where anyone can go to find symptoms similar to their own would not only be helpful to me but to others looking for assurance please post as many descriptive experiences as possible as in do not say i felt bad but say exactly the physical and mental symptoms experienced i will describe my own experience below
describe your panic attacks anxiety symptoms in full detail here
has it helped you i have had a couple panic attacks in the last year and my cousin who is a nurse gave me about half her bottle of welbutrin i cannot tell if it is making a difference or not yet but i know that i still get anxious i had a panic attack last week or so so maybe not i do not know someone help i wish this would just go away
has anyone ever taken welbutrin for anxiety
just a curious question i do not want any thoughts on the consequences of smoking i am just curious how many of you do smoke cigarettes for your anxiety and panic does it help every forum and place that i have heard of considers nicotine as something that makes anxiety worse does it help anyone i do see a lot of stressed people smoking i know it is not healthy yet again just a hypothetical
anxiety nicotine
i have told myself over and over that i should get help but i am still hesitant why i do not know i guess that by getting help i feel like i have failed somehow i am terrified of getting on medication because i fear that if something happens i will not be able to control it even though i have really bad panic attacks i know it is my body creating them not any medication this probably does not make much sense i am going to make an appointment to see a therapist tomorrow my question is has anyone beaten their anxiety if so how do you do it today was particularly pretty bad for me and so i spent most of my day sitting in front of my computer using video games to take my mind off of being anxious i went outside and took a short walk for a bit but that is about it it is getting harder to leave my house and i fear that i will never be the way i was i fear that i will not be able to enjoy going places or hanging out with friends or experiencing new areas like i used to i fear those things now i am sure i will be told i need to get help and i do want to i am just curious of anyone s opinion as well
has anyone beaten this on their own
trying to figure out my life and schedule and what i am doing and will i have plans this weekend i know its all part of social anxiety but i could really really use some tips really
dae get anxiety about making plans or other social anxiety discussion
hello again i may be posting a little too much it is just that i have done really nothing today and have had a lot of time to think about my anxiety depression and life in general i formulated a plan for the next month for myself this is all based around opinions from various people and thoughts pertaining to lowering my anxiety and agoraphobia i will follow a couple of basic steps for the next month and see how my anxiety improves if it does not by the end then i will seek medical help for my symptoms first step spending less time on the computer i currently spend anywhere from 10 12 hours in front of my computer per day especially now that i do not have a job anymore the computer has become my main hideaway and distraction i believe too much of it is causing my dizziness and worsening my anxiety and depression second step exercise this one is simple but will be difficult to get into a routine with i enjoy biking especially trails i plan on doing some form of cardio exercise for at least one hour per day this all stems from the fact that i feel my happiest when i have worn myself out during the summer i went on a family vacation one the beach for a week strait during that time i was in the water 8 hours a day and never that incredible in years my appetite was amazing and my mood was fantastic i hope to attain that again through exercise step 3 eating and sleeping better currently i wake up around 1030 or 11 and eat a small unhealthy breakfast followed by an upset stomach and around 1 or 2 i will eat a decent lunch etc i end up snacking a lot at night and fall asleep around 2 or 3 i would like to start eating more balanced meals and eating larger during the earlier hours of the day i will have to start going to sleep and getting up earlier which i believe the exercise will help me with wearing me out snacking late at night does not help my stomach aches in the morning either that is my plan the only hard part is sticking to it for the next month what do you think
my plan for the next month
this may seem a bit contradictory to a lot of people s opinions but is anyone else like me afraid to seek help with their anxiety i have been to a couple months of cbt which helped for a while but inevitably my anxiety came back i lost my job to my panic attacks and suffer from daily stress and anxiety to the point where my mind is constantly racing i suffer from occasional dizzy spells and am fearing that since i lost my job i am getting more and more afraid of leaving my house i do not have health insurance so seeing a psychiatrist is pretty much out of the question i am forced to go to medical or mental health clinics around my area i am afraid of being labeled as a nutcase and also i am afraid of getting on medication i have heard from different people all over that since they have been on theirs it has drastically helped them i am just afraid that if i do get on something i am worried it could change me for the worse at least when i have panic attacks and anxiety now i know that it is my sober body doing it to me once i get on medication i am weary of the potential side effects and problems that could arise from it is this an illegitimate fear i mean after all i guess if it got too bad i could just get off of it opinions anyone
anyone else afraid to seek help
so i have had these vertigo attacks from what i can remember i have had about 8 or 9 of them over the last couple years afterwards i am usually a little dizzy for a week or two after them my last one was about a week ago most of them have happened while at the computer but two happened when i was outside basically what happens is that i feel like someone is pushing me or turning my head to the left really quick sometimes my ear will start ringing as well then i will get extremely dizzy for a few seconds and i will be thrown immediently into a panic attack has this happened to anyone else i think it is a main problem with my anxiety and i do not know if it is causing it or a product of anxiety

hello everyone again so i have decided i am going to try and see a doctor tomorrow i have made an appt to see a therapist but it is not until the 17th of march the last few days i have been feeling really dizzy and lightheaded i do not know if this has anything to do with my anxiety or not but the feeling of having it does make me anxious this has happened a couple times in the past since i have had my anxiety basically what happens everytime is that i will be doing something sitting in front of my computer or my friend driving me home the last two times and it will feel like someone started pushing my head over like my vision would twist and it would feel like i am falling to the side or falling over as soon as this would happen i would be thrown into an intense panic attack and i would be dizzy for the rest of the day or even the rest of the week like the last two times my problem is that i have gone to the doctor for this last time ears checked out ok i was told it could be an inner ear infection i got better eventually the only blood test i have had was to check out my thyroid level which turned out high but still in the normal levels i have been told before that my panic attacks and anxiety depression from them is just panic disorder and usually was given paxil or prozac which i have not taken when i go tomorrow should i tell the doctor everything that is been going on should i ask for a blood test or something of the sort i know i may sound like a hypochondriac but i am extremely scared that there is something wrong with me i also do not have health insurance so the consequence of me being extremely sick frightens me as well i guess i am ranting now what do you guys think
seeing a doctor tomorrow
i have suffered anxiety and panic attacks on a regular basis since the day i turned 20 literally that very day began a panic attack that lasted a whole week and prevented me from leaving my bed almost entirely the main trigger has always been fear of heart issues any time i had have a little flutter or notice it was beating stronger and faster than i thought it should be at that point in time i had become anxious then the symptoms would grow from the anxiety and feed itself until it became panic this happened constantly endlessly almost daily lately over the past 6 months i have finally been overcoming them and now i am at the point where i almost never get a heart related anxiety issue i have brought it completely under control although i still have a few other anxiety triggers i have a phobia of vomiting so things like acid reflux and indigestion are very strong triggers and i get those a lot i have managed to almost completely eliminate my fear of heart problems as a trigger today is the first day in a long time that i have had an anxiety attack related to my fear of heart problems my heart has been feeling strange since 4pm and it is now 3am it feels like there is a giant air pocket filling my chest cavity where my heart should be though i am extremely aware of my heart beat it almost feels as if it is weak and tired i have managed to hold back the anxiety attack all this time expecting the symptom to go away eventually as i convince myself that it is nothing to be afraid of and that nothing is actually wrong with me but it is not going away and now i am worried i can feel a self feeding anxiety attack ready to pounce on me i am not going to look up these symptoms on the google machine because we all know exactly what will happen panic will be inevitable i will be convinced i have cancer heart failure and am having a stroke all at once and panic will ensue instantaneously my concern is that this symptom is just not going away it is almost been 12 hours what on earth should i do
so i have been making amazing progress in getting over the majority of my anxiety attacks but right at this moment i am having an attack that seems impossible to stop
hello wonderful people of reddit i hope i am in the right place i need some opinions so as the title says i have been having chronic dizziness before i give a little background on myself i want to say that when this bout of dizziness started i immediately went to doctors and found out that nothing is physically wrong with me medically i am perfectly healthy i am a college student that took a semester off in the fall i get great grades do not do drugs hang out with great people and overall have not run into any trouble i am usually a positive and outgoing person but those few months off from school changed me i lived at home with my parents from september to january which is when my chronic dizziness started my home is unstable and my parents are both bipolar and controlling my parents marriage is far from happy and the only time they do not fight is when they join forces to abuse me they are very sure that i am wrapped up in the drug scene and that i party my life away at school some nights they stayed up and watched me because they thought i was strung out on drugs once again no drugs here they threatened to put me in community college to watch me if i ever came home a few minutes later than my curfew they screamed for hours and said i was such a disappointment and an overall bad kid on multiple occasions my dad has shouted demeaning things at me for no reason and hit me it s not ok to hit your kids anymore when they are in their 20s they are very paranoid people when i get upset over what they say they act like they never said anything they deny all of the abuse that they just threw at me they also have no idea why i get upset and deny all of their verbal abuse sometimes things just go right back to normal after they have accused me of being a drug addict and a failure many more things have happened but these are some examples my parents have made me uncomfortable in my own house and even in my own skin in just a few months i have never had any anxiety problems but this abuse from my parents caused me to have a decent amount of anxiety in november i started to get dizzy every day to the point where i could not drive anywhere as i said before i went to doctors and got many tests that concluded that i was perfectly healthy once i moved out to go to school for this spring semester my dizziness went away the physical problem that was interfering with my life simply evaporated which i was okay with i was just happy that it was finally gone and i was happy to be away from my household however now when i come home on the weekends for local job obligations the dizziness returns my relationship with my parents is now civil but my issues with them were never really resolved they are still bipolar and abusive to each other but not me could it be that this dizziness returns simply because i am back in my house could just sitting in my house subconsciously cause anxiety which makes me dizzy short version college student that does not get into trouble took semester off and lived with verbally abusive parents developed chronic dizziness physically healthy went away to school dizziness went away came back home and got dizzy again can just being in my house alone cause me to be dizzy which means that my dizziness is anxiety i am too broke to afford therapy myself so i would really love to get some opinions thanks reddit

herbal supplements for anxiety x post from r anxiety
lately i have been having some overwhelming anxiety i used to have it a lot but then when i got really busy i no longer had time to feel it after the last two months becoming extremely stressful i noticed its crept back into my life right now i have bad overwhelming anxiety it feels like my entire chest has tightened i am very dreadful terrified that something is going to happen to me these bouts of anxiety i think are related to noticeable sleep apnea conditions before i fall asleep i wake up with a fright or like i need to breath it takes a long time to fall asleep when this happens i usually wake up with terrible anxiety i have to wake up in 3 hours and on top of that work fairly late today is there anybody out there that can just set me straight
overwhelming anxiety
it is not bad but noticeable i will notice everyonce in a while usually during times of being really anxious my vision kind of shakes it will feel as though when something is stationary it is moving a little or jittery i do not know if it is my eyes because i am anxious or maybe it is just due to the fact that i spend a lot of time on the computer i also wear glasses if this helps
does anyone else have distorted vision with their anxiety
hi everyone i just found this subreddit and figured it might be a place to vent some of my feelings and prove to myself that i am not crazy i have had three major episodes of panic anxiety attacks in my life where an episode is a series of the attacks that lasts for several days or weeks i have been anxious for a couple days all day today and had a full blown attack earlier so i fear i might be slipping back into another episode is not it insidious how the fear of having the attacks makes you have them anyway just wondered if anyone out there is had the same experiences when i get attacks i feel really cold feel like i cannot breathe my mind starts racing usually a xanax helps calm that down but the one i took earlier is not doing much so far i read somewhere that it can take a few doses of it to really get control of yourself back i hope its not long is this true i do not really know what this post is for other than to just get it out there thanks for listening
here we go again
i usually feel as if the inside of my skin is burning or cold as well it usually lasts a couple of seconds also i feel tingling or small waves of electricity in my head arms legs hands and last but not least i have been feeling a very annoying pressure in my head and when i walk i feel really weird as if my body was very weak and i could fall any minute does anyone else experience things like these
dae feel cold hot flashes in random body parts tingling and general body weakness

the old world wrecked havoc on the new world by the spread of diseases i get that europeans had a lot of diseases that the natives had not been exposed to but would not that work the other way too my understanding is that because they lived more sparsely disease was less rampant but i still feel like there would have been some diseases europeans had not seen before
why did europeans spread their diseases to native americans but not vice versa

the most obvious example is the european domination of the native americans however i want to know of different instances of this behavior between civilizations i would prefer an example with the aggressor being a non european people my motivation for asking this stems from my observation that this behavior is commonly attributed to europeans and not other races at least in my experience and i would like to know if this is a phenomenon that has occurred between non european people as well edit the amount of feedback and great answers i have gotten is astonishing and i had like to thank everyone who has contributed but it seems like i worded this is a confusing way i did not mean simply examples of conquest and warfare in which a civilization dominates another but rather the outright annihilation and suppression of a civilization and culture that would compare to the downfall of the native americans i apologize for not being more specific
what is an example of a stronger more advanced civilization dominating a weaker less advanced civilization through violent and even genocidal means
i have done a lot of research into this and it seems like frameworks for how tribes interact with the state generally subscribe to what ibn khaldun said that they rebel when a central state is strong and submit when it is weak lots of historians and political scientists have tried to expand on that further i was wondering if anyone knew of a particular text or author that had a compelling theory which supported or disagreed with that point of view
how did tribes interact with the state in the arab world historically or in modern times

i have read a few different stories about how similar latin and the language of the gauls was how did 2 seemingly unrelated languages come to be so similar i assumed it was because they are both close enough to proto indo european to have lots of similarities and chance geography did the rest was i far off

hello in paintings and photographs of soldiers specifically officers i have noticed that they carried a sword the 1800 and 1900 s were well into the age of gunpowder so my question is how effective were these swords in combat against rifles how often were they actually used in battle rather than for ceremonies why did not officers have long rifles like their enlisted counterparts and when did officer s decide swords were useless on the field of battle answers will be appreciated very much gators edit i should also add when exactly did officer s begin to use rifles more
question swords on the battlefields of the 1800 1900s

sorry for the title gore but this has been bothering me for a while and i wanted to be as clear as possible as far as i know all imperial courts have been rife with people deceiving and screwing over one another in the search for power but i have not been able to find a word phrase that encapsulated this the best example i can give is the modern english phrase a game of thrones which has been used in this context in popular media because of the hbo show s popularity and was not used before 2010 according to google trends
did any major empire in history have a word or phrase that encapsulated the phenomena of many different people in a court vying for each other s high ranking titles such as lord or king
i remember hearing how bloody some of these wars were and i was just think about how we do not really think about anything bad happening to us until it actually does is there actually a statistical probability describing how likely it would be for someone joining to military then that they would die lets say i am in the us how does the probability here compare to other countries
if i joined the military in wwi wwii what would the probability be that i would not be coming home

i am curious as to the distinction between irish culture and religion compared to other ancient civilizations such as ancient britain ireland from my understanding has always been the island of the celts however caesar describes differing tribes in the gaelic region france as including the celts among many others this does not make sense in the modern conventional use of the celts unless there is a large unified tribe extending from ireland to france is there a definitive cultural boundary for ireland i am especially interested in religious traditions personally but anything you guys know regarding my question would be fantastic thank you

chernobyl and fukashima are the worlds two worst nuclear disasters both rating at level 7 s according to the i n e s and reminded us why nuclear reactors are a dangerous source of energy but if someone asked what is the third someone would probably say i do not know and i do not blame them i am posting this to stop that post this is the story of the kyshtym disaster to get a understanding of the importance of the area you have to have a basic understanding of the cold war and mayak the cold war was a consequence of the second world war its all very debatable and this is very basic background information because it left two super powers the us and ussr both wanting to rebuild war torn germany unfortunately the us is capitalist and the ussr is communist they would then go on for decades fighting a war with no battles an arms race for nuclear power and space mayak was one of the biggest nuclear facilities in russia at the time known as chelyabinsk 40 and was incredibly secret towns were built nearby like ozyorsk also known as city 40 this city was the home to all the staff who work at mayak and the children who grew up there went even told why it was so secret the city even had checking systems and soldiers around the city the disaster was called the kyshtym disaster because kyshtym was the nearest town which was not secret mayak was dumping nuclear waste into the techa river which went into the river ob and then the arctic ocean for open air storage this dumping had horrible effects on the local environment and villagers on the 29th of september 1957 after about 10 years of covert work a underground cooling system which contained about 70 80 tonnes of dangerous radioactive waste failed it was not repaired this resulted in a huge chemical explosion with a force around 70 100 tonnes of t n t although the actual explosion did not kill anyone it realized a huge radioactive cloud which travelled 20 thousand square kilometres this is were it got bad for russia over ten thousand people were evacuated from the area but this took anywhere from 3 11 years this was because of the huge secrecy behind mayak and the near towns 22 towns villages where exposed to the radiation and a large area of the environment was poisoned the result on the people was horrible to say the least leukemia rates went up and stomach cancer was two or three times greater than in survivors of nagasaki or hiroshima because not many people new about the effects of radiation when the sighs hit people panicked skin was said to be sloughing of peoples faces and other parts of there body but even now the effects can still be seen survivors normally do not live into the 50 s and their children suffer diseases and malformations from birth even though the ussr tried to keep mayak a secret the cia still new about it fortunately for the ussr the cia also decided to keep it secret no one really knows why they did decided not to tell anyone but one of the most popular theories are that they did not want to insight fear in the us they had there own nuclear research and they would have the own disasters this took me a long time to write and a lot of research if i misspelt any of the names i am sorry i am not a professional historian just incredibly interested in the cold war and hope to do more of these in the future i would also love to discuss in the comments whether you think the cia did the right thing your views on the secrecy whether the ussr should have kept it secret etc i would even love it if you corrected me so i could edit it into the post thanks for reading

i have to say about 90 of all western films and tv shows i have seen depict it as this savage place filled with violence debauchery and all kinds of uncivilized behavior pulling from your knowledge of the history of the american west is this fairly accurate or is this an extreme media cultural exaggeration as usual
was the old american west nearly as savage as shown on tv
i know the first one broke down and had to be replaced however i could not find anything on what happened to the 2nd one did it just fall into disuse if so is it still usable furthermore why did they just abandon it if it was abandoned to me it does not make sense that they built this massive cable that was a joint european and american effort that was hailed as the technological innovation of the day and then suddenly abandoned without any sort of fanfare and faded into the halls of time
what happened to the transatlantic cable
americans had been using lever action rifles through their civil war and the wild west period yet europeans used single shot breechloaders that while doing lots of damage to the individual strikes me as less useful when you want to conquer a portion of a continent as fast as possible why did they not use them at least at a large extent
why did europeans use breechloading rifles instead of lever action rifles in their conquest of africa through the late 1800s
europe first was a strategy in which the us and the uk promised to use most of their forces to fight germany first but when the us entered world war ii they concentrated most of their forces on fighting japan until the invasion of normandy in 1944 why was this
despite the europe first strategy why did the us send most of it is forces to the pacific first during wwii
this is one of those things that has bothered me for years but i have never really delved too deeply into finding an answer from the very little i know about japan i had expect the tiny island nation that has repeatedly been on the wrong side of history to be an incredibly weak world power but they are not from a primarily eurocentric educational perspective whenever i hear anything about japanese history it usually begins with someone mentioning the samurai then maybe a mention of picking the wrong side in wwii then getting nuked twice and then spontaneously springing up everywhere in the 80s before slipping into a less dominant but still substantial world position today so my question is why is japan one of the world s more powerful economies militaries and tech hubs when the only things i ever hear about related to japanese history tend to be bad things
how has japan risen to be one of the most powerful nations in the world
i have often been wondering as i have been reading more and more about medieval infantry what exactly did people wear when they did not have full plate armor because to my understanding not everyone could afford full plate armor and very few armies were actually completely clad in full plate i think people wore gambesons and mail or both when they did not have the luxury of full plate its just that everytime i play a video game or roleplay theres always going to be a group of thugs or mercenaries who all wear leather armor and from what i have been told leather armor was simply not as prevalent as hollywood makes it out to be studded leather armor was supposedly nonexistent as well so what would be a cheap or suitable historically accurate armor set that would constitute as light or medium style armor edited i also was interested to know what was worn with gambesons
what constitutes as light or medium style armor

did soldiers who died in battle or war any wars know they were going to die or all thought they had be the lucky ones to survive
it seems to be a social contruct it mainly leads to a double standard when it comes to guys girls sleeping with somebody logically it does not make any sense why it would be morally wrong for a girl not to be pure or for her to be straight foward or hook up when a its okay for a guy to do it 1 when did this start 2 why did it happen i figured the historians would know if it is in human nature or if it was a social construct based on their findings
when why did virginity purity become an important value for women in human history
in studying china in college most reads relating to japan were relegated to the relationship of the two countries and the effect of the meiji restoration on qing dynasty china other books i have come across attempt to sum up too much history far too quickly for instance contemporary to ancient in 200 pages i would like to delve deeper into pre restoration history any suggestions would be greatly appreciated

almost every army used them but i cannot get a straight answer as to why i have found half a dozen different answers none of which seems to make sense wikipedia says for comfort and support others say to protect the shins to prevent being caught on barbed wire to keep boots laced or help boots fit better none of those answers really make sense they obviously had some purpose or they would not have been so widely adopted but after ww1 they were suddenly abandoned for normal pant legs

in our modern day it seems like it is really competitive being to be an officer in the us or british military i was an enlisted infantry soldier in the us military and most of my pls platoon leaders came from west point a very hard military school to get into or had awards that made them highly distinguished like a ranger tab it seems like it is very competitive to be an officer was it as competitive during wwi and wwii when more soldiers were needed did those that had bachelors degrees automatically made them officers what was the process of soldiers becoming an officer back then what was the process to be a fighter pilot during the wwi and wwii being a fighter pilot now is very competitive its pretty much akin to wanting to be a movie star an out of reach goal for most people i could not find a lot information that satisfied my questions i appreciate your time in replying back thanks

history is full of examples of cities being sacked whether its by bashful barbarians jaded jihadists conquering crusaders nonsensical nomads so on and so forth but what exactly happens during a sack rome seemed to have been sacked multiple times but there are still ancient buildings standing to this day constantinople was sacked but it still remained one of the most important centres of the world what happens during a sack how come people still live in the city after a sacking is it just because these cities are normally important areas for large populations what do the conquerors do to the people living in the city and how does a city pick itself back up any examples of considerations that conquerors might have had before burning the place down if burnings occurred how much destruction is considered for a sack or is the term used too liberally to pin down throughout history

i just do not understand what the point of it was i mean i could understand it if it was putting people who were born in japan and lived a while there and then moved to the states i would not agree with it but it had be understandable considering what was going on but if someone was born in america grew up there and viewed it as their true home but happened to have japanese parents or heritage why throw them into a camp too if they were born in america and grew up the american way then why would you assume that they had be loyal to hirohito or japan when they were never indoctrinated
in world war 2 why were people who were born in america but had japanese heritage put into internment camps

what was an overall view of china in the early 18th century
the wikipedia pages on the matter still fail to clarify some points when i first thought about it i wondered does a retreating force present its back to the enemy probably not all at once i presume i get the impression that an orderly retreat was performed company by company with the mass of the army holding their ground while only the company whose turn it was would move towards the rear i am also curious about the order in which sections of the army would retreat would the units nearest to the enemy be the first to retreat or the last while the units are moving away from the battlefield are not they vulnerable to an enemy charge how do you adequately cover them without risking the loss of the covering units
what exactly constitutes an orderly retreat in the pre rifle gunpowder era

here s the text in russian the source is listed as a book published in russia in the 1990s so although it might be taken with a grain of salt overall style seems to fit to teacher comrade martyshin i have received your letter about escapades of vasily stalin thank you for the letter replying with a great delay because of being overloaded with work my apologies vasily is a spoiled young man of average abilities little wildman not always honest likes to blackmail weak teachers not rarely an insolent fellow with weak or more accurately unorganized willpower he was spoiled by various god fathers and god mommies who continually emphasize that he is stalin s son i am glad that in your person there is at least one self respecting teacher who treats vasily as everyone else and demands that the insolent boy follows the school s policy vasily is spoiled by principals like the one you mentioned washcloth people means spinless in rus who have no place at school and if insolent vasily has not destroyed himself yet it is because our country still has teachers who do not give slack to the little young swell my advice demand stricter from vasily and do not be affraid of fake blackmail threats of suicide from the capricious child you will have my support unfortunately i do not have the opportunity to fuss with vasily myself but promise to grab him by the collar from time to time cheers edit vasily was born in 1921 so he was 17 in 1938 edit 2 comments say that washcloth can be translated as wet rag or limp rag it does seem to sound better

sometimes it is really interesting to me when maybe looking at a field or something void of man made things that that is exactly how the ancient world would have looked full of color vibrant and alive even people too sometimes i will see someone and they just look like they could have been born 2000 years ago and vice verse if you took any person from years ago but they were born today perhaps snatched an ancient roman right as they were born they would fit in just fine maybe they had love video games love cars and perhaps be no different from your average man seeing black and white photographs whose quality gets worse the further back in time you go gives a false perception of the world look outside that is what it looked like not some grainy greyscale world this is also why i love seeing colorized photgraphs it just seems to add another layer of realness to it edit wow so i read through all the comments and it brought up some more interesting points how much do you know about your great great grandfather do you even know what he looks like with today s technology our great ancestors hundreds of years in the future will see our life in hd or perhaps hd will seem unimaginable unsophisticated but my ancestors in 500 years could see videos of me with friends making dumb home videos laughing into the camera playing sports and they could see the great leaders and events today 9 11 will probably be taught in history class for hundreds of years they will not just read out of a text book though they will see the videos

i just had a pretty long involved conversation with someone and i have to share it somehow why not the history sub today he works at a gas station that nearly shares a parking lot with my job i am night shift obviously since it is 0530 and so is he he is gassing up my truck and i asked about his accent i am interested in the world so it was a friendly question he is turkish but lived in kazak ssr in the ussr he was drafted into the red army 1983 1986 as a grunt infantrymen guard i am a us army vet my dad was in the marines in the 80 s and some of his stories make me realize how much the military has changed in just 30 years but this man s story made it seem like we were recounting world war two conditions basic training was relatively short as he had a para military education in high school his job he was not specific on a job title such as a us army mos he did say guard but was not military police training was ojt at his unit there would be a squad of new guys who were hazed tormented shown the ropes by the rest of the company he stayed in the kazak region for this period and his units purpose was to guard a center for radiation i dug at that and i think it was either a nuclear weapons site research site or test site which used army soldiers as physical security gate guards they checked id s roved the perimeter and held exercises on the immediately adjacent grounds he had an rpg 7 but never fired it there was never a rocket available they did have ammunition for makarov pistols and ak47 rifles no heavy weapons of any kind this was a cake assignment and the men knew it moral was so so boredom was the worst enemy they lived on site the workers lived on site the necessary civilians lived on site it was almost a prison environment the nearest town was many hours drive away but hardly anyone got to visit for any reason this is not the hell part yet after 1 year his unit was suddenly tasked to go to latvia region for a war exercise like a force on force war game keep in mind these are 90 simple kazak draftees who have been sitting on their butts for years with no real weapons no real training or experience and suddenly they are under the microscope for an exercise they were given all officers who had been to afghanistan but none of the enlisted men had been they were utterly destroyed by the opposing force and made complete fools of themselves there were even fatal accidents one man accidentally shot one of the senior inspectors with his rifle a tank had rolled over some men in a ditch and killed them a man was crushed between two trucks several men were injured as they were made to crawl over or under barbed wire with real explosives going off next to them these were flares meant to simulate artillery but were powerful enough to burn due to their big fat failure on this exercise they went to the ussr turkey border as guards to a penal unit of military prisoners this was punishment for the entire unit and all its mid and higher level ncos and officers were stripped of rank and they served together as grunts with a new cadre of officers assigned to them this is where the real hell started keep in mind these are the guards not the prisoners themselves they were on near starvation rations those who did not steal from the local populace would go hungry they would steal from each other they were beaten by their superiors threatened with court martial if they made any simple mistake there were political officers at this unit and any denunciation could send you to siberia or literally to death some men were executed for voicing concerns that they would starve to death on the issued rations not on the spot but tried in court found guilty and then executed by firing squad in winter several men did die of exposure many more prisoners died of over work on construction projects starvation disease and exposure this man started losing teeth his hair was falling out and even his nails were getting brittle and breaking sometimes the prisoners would attack the guards his friend was hit in the head with a shovel and killed in front of him he was attacked and stabbed several times he said the prisoners were mostly thugs and mentally unstable who had been drafted committed crimes in the military and sentenced to build roads or similar for life he did participate in some prisoner beat downs but he says he did not kill anybody a form of punishment was to tie up a prisoner naked and pour boiling water on him with a drinking cup then vodka over the wound it was like a prison war within a military one day his time was up he was discharged on the spot at the station where he was serving but his train pass was not for his home city the authorities decided he should now live in a city elsewhere in the country a soviet citizen was not allowed to decide where to call home apparently he was assigned a job in industry it was already arranged for him rather than this he used his knowedge of the border area to escape into turkey he was a turk after all he lived there for years before emigrating to the us and now he pumps gas at night i know dictatorship militaries are basic and unforgiving but men were executed for voicing concern about their safety and this happened in modern times whether it was a reflection of the soviet army or of his particular penal control unit i do not know he said everywhere soviet soldiers were hungry under equipped poorly led and morale was terrible then again his experience is limited to kazak region 1 war game and penal duty i am kind of mind blown to be honest i had to let it out of me
apparently life as a soviet army soldier circa 1980s was hell

or are the two even related linguistically i have been on a pre wwi history kick lately and the region of the caucasus and the slavic world in general at and before that time are greatly interesting and as a white relatively well educated citizen of the united states with an admittedly limited world view fairly alien to me i am also concurrently on an age of exploration kick as well and both periods have pretty heavy undertones of meddling in the regions surrounding the black sea this was just sort of a diversion and nagging question at the back of my mind edit my intention with this question was not to open a discussion or debate over race as even the concept of race is debatable my curiosity ends at the etymology of the word caucasian as it relates to geography and history alone thankfully my question has been answered and my curiosity quenched by many wonderful and properly cited sources thank you to everyone who contributed meaningfully
q at what point did the word caucasian stop referring to the people of the caucasus and start referring to white people in general

so i found a lot of boxes one such box of letters in my mother s loft attic hundreds some from ww1 the rest from ww2 they are completely original in envelopes with post marks etc and in pretty good condition i thought this one was interesting as the soldier writing mentions german snipers and ruined french towns and some fairly mundane things too dated 22 aug 1915 sent to my great grandparents by this young man in the army in the trenches fighting the germans in the north east of france in loos near lille near the border with belgium the letter is from private edward currie 12th battalion highland light infantry british expeditionary force he was killed on 25 sept 1915 34 days after writing this and is buried in loos memorial pas de calais france it is quite hard to read from the images here is a transcription pte edw currie 19054 d coy 12th batt h l i b e f 22nd aug 1915 dear mam i now take time to write to you as i know you are anxious to hear from me i had made up my mind not to write to you again after our little difference of opinion but it was against my grain as i know you were always interested in me and i know it would be too bad not to let you know how i am getting along whilst in the trenches i am in the trenches at present having a lively time of it and quite realise the murderous work the germans are doing censorship prevents me telling the names of places i have been in but they are a sight beautiful garden citys with no sign of life whatsoever with these many mansions furnished complete with the roof blown off or the gables of the wall shattered with these many shells as one goes further along only skeleton of houses are to be seen our dugouts in the trenches are furnished with mirrors chairs etc making things making things look cosy and comfortable those being had from the ruined houses close at hand by day our sentries watch over the parapet just across to the enemy s trenches a few hundred yards away if there heads were to be seen they are sure to be shot at and they are pretty good shots too they possess a set of men called snipers who seem to be everywhere that one cannot be too sure where he goes in case he is within range of one of these fellows this is all i can say about trench life in the meantime it is giving you an idea what is the case in some of the many places in france i saw mr name s brother in one of the villages i have been in he was taking over our billets for his battallion the 10th gordons as we were leaving for the trenches i myself am having a good time of it and have nothing to complain off although we are not getting it all our own way i hope to be remembered to all the boys and to those who are anxious to know how i am keeping i will close in the meantime hoping you all spent an enjoyable holiday camp thoughts of it reminding me of monkton and the good times i have spent there from yours truly eddy currie edit wow thank you all for the responses and pms i have replied to you all individually and am now going through the comments and will reply to any directed to me wow not sure i can keep going there is a lot note 1 monkton refers to a place near glasgow in scotland i shall find out for sure but some of you in the comments have identified the location my family is scottish pte edward currie was scottish he died 25th sept 1915 a month after this letter i have located his memorial note 2 i am so sorry the letters are not for sale these are too historically valuable and money is not deserving of their worth if you get me however i will scan more of them for those who asked i will endeavour to track down their descendants and give them the letters the rightful owners i think failing that war museums will gladly accept them i am sure i will post pte edward eddy currie s other 4 letters for you today note 3 to clarify these letters are currently in my possession rightfully and honestly these young men were hosted at a boarding house oakshaw ran by my grandfather s parents after signing up prescription and before they were posted to the south of england prior to deployment in france they wrote very kindly back to my great grandmother mam to keep her updated of how they were i assume they would also have written to their parents but of course i do not have those letters note 4 thank you humbly for the pms from current and ex military i hope my replies were worthy enough note 5 billets temporary housing for soldiers the missing words i hope to be remembered to all the boys note 6 the disagreement some of you ask about does not sound romantic more like he mis behaved before he left stole something argued about politics the war not sure i will try and find out

note my grandfather passed away last fall and we are still going through his belongings he saved many correspondence some are hard to read because the letters are handwritten and nearly 80 years old however i just came across this letter i have seen other letters from this same guy and i know he grew up in the same neighborhood with my grandfather although my grandfather and this guy went to different schools their entire lives they kept in touch while the friend was serving in ww2 i had not gotten a chance to read any letters until tonight and this was the first one i read and it is intense you ll get this when you read but it seems that my attorney grandfather had written to his friend complaining about how busy and hard his job was well as you might imagine his friend while serving in the philippines in ww2 was pretty pissed about that and he did not hold back ps thanks to commenters who are better versed in ww2 and better at reading the handwriting than i am i am making corrections and edits as they come in here s the link to the original and here s the full transcription philippine islands july 25 1945 stan from out of the philippines where it my dear lawyer is still spelled with 1 l i send a reply to one of the foulest notes that it has ever been my misfortune to receive quote as for myself i have been very busy the last week or two although the course of work in this hard boiled slave driving under paid profession etc etc well little boy you may be a shining light in the tiny legal world you exist in but the insinuation you made in your letter showed me that you do not know what life today is all about you are living in a sphere that is bound up with things cut and dried things which are dealt with as cases and not realities and yet you have the impudent gall to sit back and complain about your own way of life you who have always had a good home fine parents and sufficient funds you attended a private school a college and a law school in spite of the times you got a job in an old firm and you have your place in life in other words you have had everything handed to you on a silver platter and yet you still complain you also speak of being busy well that is a joke it seems to me that i have heard of some others who are busy today have you heard of the b 29 boys over japan or the carrier task force or the boys who took back the philippines or the 19 000 boys who had a busy time on okinawa or the guys on saipan guam new guinea or guadalcanal or course the aussies are not busy on borneo of course not no these guys and millions of others are merely sitting around finely furnished offices and telling others they have been very busy as for being hard boiled there is no such thing in the service all those with whom we associate treat us like their own children things are always calm and serene the cases one finds are never crude or tough the stinking corpses of american boys boys whom life never gave a chance are nice things to observe no life in this business is not hard boiled if it is not then neither is a sniper s bullet thru the forehead and then you mentioned slave driving the phrase used by you is sheer mockery the works of the coalies on the great airfields of china was sheer pleasure the anzio beachead was a picnic for the boys carving out that tiny foothold the boys who spanned the plane under point blank fire were having an enjoyable time the guys who lugged ashore on their backs the supplies that helped to take tarawa were just getting some exercise no this was not slave driving work it was mere amusement as one might take back home on a quiet sunday afternoon and then you said under paid that is just plain riot the boys who were killed at pearl harbor were under paid the men at kiska and attu were under paid the boys who hit the beach of normandy were underpaid the maquis of france were under paid no according to you these men were making a fortune some will come back but is the stinking 50 a month overpaying a dead american private in the lonely mountains of italy is the service pay of a pilot too much of course he may come back but there is a chance he may be just charred remains in a wrecked plane he does not earn his money he is overpaid yes the boys who invade japan will be overpaid it is too bad that the legal profession cannot pay off like the services fighting this war yes we are all wealthy men according to your idea of being underpaid stan i have always respected you for your knowledge and ability but you seem to be so wrapped up in that smug little world of yours that you do not know what is going on in terms of reality you see newsreels read papers scan magazines and that makes you a judge of your position whether you know it or not you are a very lucky guy you have your education your job and future planned and then on top of that you have the audacity to write hard boiled slave driving under paid profession if this letter does nothing else i hope that it makes you ashamed of yourself right down to the marrow of your bones you may say now who is brown that he can pass judgment on the great lawyer granted to your way of thinking he is not in a position to do so i think differently i am a guy who only had three years in college i never graduated or went on to a professional school i know very little in the formal sense of the word but you ungrateful wretch i still know more about life than you ever will unless you change i have seen life in its rawest and crudest and death too for that matter yes my sheltered intellect the intellect the sordid and foul things of life can teach lessons i have learned things and learned to appreciate things that only the college of life can teach i do not regret this in fact i am proud of it and i think i will be a better person for all of it if you are half a man you will make some reply to what i have written above i realize that it may not be a finely phrased but the truth is not always finely phrased your obedient slave sgt richard h brown army air forces somewhere in the philippines edit i am almost certain that i found sgt brown s obituary and i have identified a surviving daughter interestingly enough if it is the right obituary and the daughter is the person i am thinking of i actually went to school with sgt brown s grandson for a few years and our families know each other having met at school functions in the past i will be reaching out to sgt brown s daughter today to offer her these letters edit 2 left a voicemail on the only number i found on the daughter guess i can only wait and see edit 3 welp obligatory thanks for the gold i left another voicemail on another number i found waiting on a call back so unfortunately no real updates glad this meant so

these tapes are actual real life footage of the discovery of nazi concentration camps by british and american solders after the end of ww2 alfred hitchcock arranged them in the format that they were originally meant to be viewed disclaimer what you are about to watch is extremely disturbing and includes depictions of actual death starvation disease suffering and torture it is horrific watch at your own risk edit spelling update 1 thank you for up voting this and promoting this video i think it is very important that people see this remember what happened and honor those who died i have read every one of your comments and you are all good people continue to show kindness to others online and off thanks again update 2 video changed to 480p without subtitles thank you u  here is the original video i posted with dutch subs also on the pbs website update 3 some additional information about the film thanks to u khnagar memory of the camps is indeed hitchock s documentary about the camps but it was not hidden from the public for fourty years after the war interest in the footage waned there were plenty of similar documentaries around and the footage used for memory of the camps was available in various film archives and institutions not at all hidden away hitchcock was involved with the documentary but it was not his creation alone and it seems that his involvement had mostly to do with how the material was structured in 1980 someone discovered the old reels though the sixth reel was missing and it was shown at the berlin film festival in 1984 and broadcast on american pbs in 1985 the youtube uploader seems to have ripped this from a 1993 vcd i remember reading earlier this year that the imperial war museum is restoring the whole original movie with the missing sixth reel and it will be shown on the bbc in 2015 for the 70th anniversary for the liberation of europe update 4 wow thanks for the gold

edit if you would like to help with the search please go to r thehuntfor852 hey everyone i was reading about the history of somalia during world war 2 i knew a bit about the war so i was just refreshing my memory however i come across mention of a naval battle off the coast of somalia apparently bombers forced u 852 to beach on the coastline during a naval battle the text is below as u 852 broke the surface her gun crews swarmed out and manned the anti aircraft guns even as the crewman were reaching their battle stations the wellingtons were starting their second strafing run the planes roared overhead and smothered the boat with fire oberleutnant georg colditz and matrosenobergefreiter josef hofer both died on the bridge u 852 was down by the stern unable to dive and under attack by this time it was clear to eck that his boat was finished while he could not save his boat he was determined to save his crew and his only hope of accomplishing this was to beach u 852 on the somaliland coast before the british sank her although doomed the u boat managed to hold off the british throughout much of the day her gunners beating off each aerial attack several of the crewmen were killed or wounded during the repeated strafing runs but causalities were surprisingly light given the circumstances that afternoon while still under attack eck managed to save the bulk of his crew by beaching his battered boat off the somaliland coast at ras hafun source theodore p savas silent hunters german u boat commanders of world war ii intrigued i dug a bit deeper but could not find much information on what happened to the wreck what i did find was that the captain was unable to scuttle the ship so the british were able to loot the boat since i am in somalia i decided to google the town ras hafun in somali xaafuun i then zoomed in and went along the coast i was shocked to find what resembles a wreckage i am not 100 sure but the rock formations resemble those in the few photos that remain of the wreckage here is what i found wikipedia for photos of the wrecked boat from ww2 and notice the rock formations google map of the this could obviously be the wreckage of any ship or it could be nothing at all i was hoping for you guys to look at this and to get your opinions on the following 1 does this resemble the wreckage of a uboat 2 is the location of the wreck sufficient with the historical material 3 do you notice similar wrecks in the area if there is enough interest i can make a trip to the region it will take atleast 2 days and some planning to check out the site and confirm please let me know what you think edit map showing location of u 852 edit2 some sources say it was beached near bandarbeyla far away from ras hafun i search this coast and was unable to find much can some people check out the coast here edit3 i found an raf report that says the wreckage was just south of ras hafun this would coorespond with the wreckage found on google maps in addition i found a classified australian military report on the incident it is quite detailed just ctrl f 852 edit 4 is anyone in the uk there are numerous photos oral and written accounts of the battle and search for u 852 however they take quite a while to respond to me and charge a large fee to get the documents digitally can someone go to the imperial war museum in london in order to get copies of those documents edit 5 can someone look at 9 576783 50 803232 and tell me if it resembles a submarine i see two distinct shapes it is 100km from the original site though so i am wondering if i should venture out edit 6 important if you would like to help with the search please go to r thehuntfor852 edit 7 a user found a map showing the current wreck site it is 100km south from where we thought the wreck we were looking at may actually be from 1870 please refer to this link for the update

i was on a road trip and stopped at the booker t washington national monument in virginia while reading one of the information posts one sentence resonated with me in such a way that i walked away with a new understanding of what slavery in the united states was like addressing the slave trade it read along the lines of while physical punishment was certainly a factor that kept slaves working to produce high quality crops an even larger factor was the possibility of family members being sold away if crops did not yield enough money for the plantation owners slaves worked to keep their families together that really just portrays the horror of slavery in a way that no textbook has ever been able to for me honored to see all of the discussion i hope to read through it all

we know about some germans that during wwii helped people that were endarged by the nazis actions e g oskar schindler and others from righteous among the list i wonder if there were any japanese who opposed their country s attrocities in asia and somehow helped oppresed people i found out about chiune but he operated in europe i am more interested in similar situations on the territories conquered by japan during wwii do you know any edit it seems that my choice of the title for this thread was slightly unfortunate i am not implying that every japanese was evil during wwii only searching for known examples of decent behavior in the face of atrocities for example some officer lodging a protest to his superiors about some massacre not sure if this was even possible in japanese imperial military culture i do not know a lot about it

i went through all 12 years of gov t schooling in the us and heard about it is greatness and achievements for all 12 of them including but not limited to the civil war freeing the slaves the victory of wwii defeating hitler it was not until moving to canada and being exposed to non us gov t regulated learning material that i learned about monumental failures and embarrassments those include the failed invasion of canada in 1812 the japanese internment camps in wwii freeing only the southern slaves to cripple the rebel s economy during the civil war not to mention the constitution allowed states to secede and the war killed upwards of 600 000 americans by americans the incineration of hundreds thousands of non combatant citizens in hiroshima and nagasaki and other things that were not taught or spun in a favorable light to the us image i realize that all of this information could have been found on the internet or other media but alternative learning was not something that was ever suggested or encouraged in my gov t education not sure what my point is here but anyone else have similar experiences about learning something else about major historical events from a non biased perspective update ok so i realize that i am at fault for not doing independent research on the issues that i have mentioned when i was in school i did not really find history as fascinating as i do now that i am not forced to learn about it and can look into things that interest me at my own pace it is more than likely these things were addressed but in a manner that didnt grab my attention enough to make an impact and retain the information also it was naive of me to think that leaning about canadian history in canada would not also be biased thanks everyone for your comments

i was really disheartened to see how many of you grabbed on to the patriot revisionist line that use of atomic weapons on japan was necessary in the moment and somehow saved lives this is not true this is what we tell ourselves to excuse the fact that we as a nation are responsible for the 420 000 names on japan s hiroshima peace memorial the japs as president truman called them had already asked for peace 420 000 is a lot of people to get a sense of this number try to think of the population of your hometown your university your company etc and multiply it by the appropriate factor better yet imagine everything you have ever felt love sadness excitement hunger warmth hope rejection and so on then multiply it by 420 000 i m paraphrasing annie dillard here but i cannot find the exact quote i was under the impression that we proceeded with the bombing largely to scare russia out of any notion of expanding their empire after world war ii however i had like to hear the other interpretations as for evidence president truman had written in his journals that the japanese had tried to surrender previously i have posted quotes from that journal in duplicate below if you have any further information please feel free to post it however please note the source of citation and try to find items from reputable outlets if not primary sources as opposed to shit like wikipedia and warheroez net a critical message of july 12 1945 just before potsdam showed that the japanese emperor himself had decided to intervene to attempt to end the war in his private journal truman bluntly characterized this message as the telegram from the jap emperor asking for peace inspected guard and went in for lunch p m and i ate alone discussed manhattan it is a success decided to tell stalin about it stalin had told p m of telegram from jap emperor asking for peace stalin also read his answer to me it was satisfactory believe japs will fold up before russia comes in i am sure they will when manhattan appears over their homeland i shall inform stalin about it at an opportune time if anyone has anything that contradicts this please let us know

ever since i took a politics of war class two year ago in college i have wondered whether it was truly necessary to drop fat man and little boy on japan to end the war i understand the reasoning was that the alternative to this was a full scale land invasion which would have been much more costly to both sides my main question against their usage in august of 1945 was japan in a position to conduct a legitimate offensive against u s positions if not then my position is that if japan was incapable of attacking and was economically hampered by the allies blockade could not it have been possible to just sit back and wait for their inevitable surrender meaning that the dropping of these bombs was just a display of power against the soviet union or was it more likely that there would have been more deaths by starvation before japan surrendered what do you guys think edit i am looking for opinions from a pure military aspect

why has every major western power had russia as its enemy
i recently finished making a documentary on the mau mau crisis in kenya shamlessselfpromotion link here while making that documentary it dawned on me that the british not only did a ton of shitty things but they did a combination of shitty things which on their own have become infamous in other situations the reservation of american indians the british did that in almost all of their colonies in kenya they set up african reserves forced the natives off thier land and basically trapped the natives into working for them by having them pay a rent and taxes which were higher than their maximum salaries fucking over veterans the british did that too they drafted many africans into the kar during wwii promising better living conditions for them when they returned when they came back surprise the british gave them nothing when one african ethnic group the kikuyu formed a violent revolutionary organization who committed war crimes of their own including hacking a 6 year old to death and burning down entire villages the british did not pay any attention to the mau mau s claims that their land was stolen and instead thought that the mau mau were all crazy from some mental illness spread by their oathes so their solution lock up an entire ethnic group of people in concentration camps when america interned large amounts of people we payed attention to it and eventually paid reparations when the germans took millions of jews into concentration camps and slaughtered them wholesale it has been rightly recognized as one of the worst atrocities ever committed but when the british lock up over a million people depending on whose numbers you use i use caroline elkins estimates because they had the most evidence behind them at least from what i saw in concentration camps and use some of the most gruesome forms of torture ever put to use such as drilling into detainees eardrums filling their anuses with sand and water and pushing it into their intestines with sticks forcing pins into detainees fingernails and anuses clamping down on testicles with metal rods etc and almost nobody has even heard of this happening history is fickle but i had like to believe that we pay attention to things like the holocaust because not only should we learn from them but not to do so is an injustice in and of itself i feel the same way about the mau mau crisis and other atrocities committed by the british but even moreso as the world turned its back to these people and it still has barely even recognized them
why do you think many atrocities committed by the british in their colonies have gone completely ignored

plateus small mountains and volcanoes you can go from desert to beautiful forestry in a matter of minutes you head north to the colorado river where the rivers roll through seas of trees and hills you can enjoy one of the worlds worst beaches in galveston not too pretty but the history is rich in galveston and this port city serves as one of the biggest in the nation western cities hold farmers ranchers good old fashioned texas folk white black hispanic demographically we have a pretty good spread galveston houston austin and dallas are rich with business and culture these cities have their ups and downs the rich and poor but nevertheless are some of the biggest and most productive cities in the entire world san antonio bears the scars of our revolution and remains prodominately mexican both culutrally and demographically cities like shiner are german towns with the population mainly speaking german and brew shiner beer towns like west texas are czech and sell the best damn sausage i have ever eaten dallas and houston are practically twins austin seems to be the yankee safe haven in the south but i assure you that compared to our other major cities austin is relatively small if you drive twenty minutes north get off of 1 35 and go east or west you are out in hill country that is rich with agriculture houston is the same way you drive out 290 towards austin you will find yourself in college station texas really has a bad rap for racism although in every society bad apples exist i have lived here my entire life am a white middle class male and every instance of racism i have ever ran into was immediately combated you just do not see much confederate flag waving rednecks here and if you do no one likes them college station was the cotton region for texas this is probably where most people get their racist ideas from but those times are long gone a m is a huge culturally diverse college it holds to its southeren traditions but you do not see public lynchings if you travel to mississippi or arkansas you are more likely to see a segregated society this is not due to white oppression it is due to the natural course of history that naturally evolved into a segregated society both the white and black populations in the south are extremely poor the point i am trying to get across is that texans are a strange type of people all of us are little bit mexican black white farmer and city folk texas is so diverse and flexible that it hurts me to hear some of you guys call us stupid rednecks with a bad attitude towards america you are failing to recognize the beauty of our state and disrepecting its occupants while doing so now on the ideas of secession you have to understand the way texans are taught about their history and culture it is the same way all americans are taught about the revolution it is taught in way to inspire a feeling of patriotism and pride when you hear about the founding fathers standing up to the british and establishing their own country against all odds and winning a victory that resulted in the institution of democracy texans kind of have their own story we are taught that a bunch of extremely poor rowdy uneducated farmers stood up against the tyrannical mexican government and took a chunk of land they could call their own we are taught that blood was shed for our state and in any case this is always inspiring men died for the republic of texas god damnit this is not the point though the point is that texans grew up hearing all about this revolution i gurantee all of you have seen john wayne s the alamo or how travis with his sword drew a line in the sand and told everyone they were certainly all going to die and that anyone can leave at any moment but if you wish to fight to cross the line and stand with him everyone with exception to one the biggest coward in texas history crossed the line and everyone died at school we stand up and recite the texas pledge with our right hands raised to the flag we are extremely patriotic to the ideals of america but we love our state this is just something texans understand without needing to be said texas is a predominatly neoconservative political environment rick perry was elected because of his appeal to neoconservatives and the agricultural population these inhabitants believe very strongly about limited government right to gun possession and each have a sense of rebellion in each of them you can judge them for who they are or their ideology most of them are good people and grew up in an environment that breeds this ideology in recent years the state has become more purple with the major cities turning more liberal the newcoming population from northern more liberal states combat with the native population this pool of extreme nationalism breeds a ripe environment for an excitement when anyone mentions the word secession as you can imagine the civil war still plays a huge part in our everyday lives down south the recovery never truly came until the civil rights movement when racism was broadly addressed texas kept a pretty good standing after the civil war because its economy found refuge in oil i mention this because i am getting to my most important point the division of the north and south is still strong this is not recent the civil war did nothing to fix the division i put the blame on the assassination of lincoln this extreme state of poverty that persisted in the south after the years of rebuilding created a ripe situation of angst and hatred for the north after lincoln s death jackson did exactly what lincoln never wanted a punishment for the south they striped everything they owned and left them with nothing the effects of this poverty are still present this punishment led to further division that still exist today it is very important to not feed such prejudices and combat the natural tendency to point fingers and blame others texans are people just like the rest of the south although i know the south is just as guilty as pointing fingers i do not think two wrong make a right if you have never been to south come on down we have good food great music and love to drink beer and have a great time white black mexican muslim you re more than welcome we love your company and especially your business haha edit if you have never read a book by h w brands called lone star nation i would highly suggest it if you are interested in texas history it is unromanticized and well written he is a professor at u t and has many other great books as well and another edit i have removed all political views from this post because the comments are becoming a political discussion and i do not want that
for those of you wondering a little about texas and why they want to secede

i do not get it there are not that many mongols to begin with i understand they were fearsome warriors and had mastery of horses and what not but how in the world were they able to capture so much land how did they possibly have the man power to do so how did they go from a backwater nomadic kingdom to the rulers of most of the known world tactically also i do not understand how they won pitched battles because they were masters at horse archery and other nomadic styles of warfare when they faced off against more developed nations like the islamic kingdoms china and eastern europe how did they defeat them in warfare i understand how they conquered the steppe but not china the middle east and eastern europe
how did the mongols conquer so much considering they were a backwards nomadic culture
i am not sure what is going on to me but i do not like it it all started when i first started dropping acid i would feel uneasy like someone we watching me even when i was not on it i would feel as if people were staring at me but have to remind myself to be rational my life just became more stressful after that i entered what would be a very verbally and emotionally abusive relationship with a man 10 years older than me i would frequently have invasive thoughts about him being killed on the street so i became very anxious and worried for his safety after the abuse started my self esteem lowered and i attempted suicide once with an overdose of pills obviously i did not die because i am hear today to write this post at the peak of the abuse i decided to obtain an ord r of protection against the abusive asshole when i had court i was sitting in the court room in total silence and i just hear my ex say this is all your fault i heard it totally clearly i turn around and my ex is sitting far across the room staring at me but not within earshot i later asked him and he promises to me he did not say anything in fact i know he did not because he was legally barred from communicating with me and the security guard in the courtroom would have told him to stop if he started speaking to me none the less in a crowded silent court room anyways since that incident i have been having increasingly more invasive thoughts sometimes it will feel like my head is screaming i will close my eyes and see a black figure staring at me from a window and then run away i will feel like i am losing control and feel like i might flip out at my second and do something i had regret i am not actually sure what is going on but i kind it to be unpleasant i have family history of mental illness on both sides depression anxiety and addiction on my fathers side and schizophrenia depression anxiety and addiction on my father has anyone experienced anything like this before could these be the beginnings of schizophrenia

hello i apologize in advance if this is silly i just want to have different opinions on what is going on inside my head or maybe find some guidance keep in mind that i am not very talkative with my family thus i cannot really ask them about this i do not remember much of my childhood however i remember a very strange scene i was probably 4 or 5 and i was crying in the bathroom and my underwear was full of blood i also remember my mother being very angry and she was washing off the blood off my underwear in the bathroom sink i am now a 23 year old woman and i can remember this exact scene as if it happened yesterday yet i have no memory of what happened before or after that as you can see it still haunts me since i have no idea about the context i was wondering did my brain make this up i have to add something though my parents described me as a kid as a very joyful one who would even go with my parents friends easily i used to be full of life apparently and i would dance anywhere and clap my hands most of the time to show my happiness something must have changed dramatically because most of my memories after that are mostly being extremely afraid of everyone and crying a lot for example i would cry if my parents dropped me at catechism or if they were just a bit late to pick me up from school i even remember a friend of mine back in the day who would make fun of me because of how much i kept crying over nothing oh and i probably should add that i still have to this day this great habit of crying over nothing even though it is not the same reason anymore it is more because i am extremely sensitive i guess tl dr i remember a strange scene very vividly it happened when i was a child but i have no memory of its context did my brain make it up somehow to mess me up a bit more i had like to believe my brain made it up but i am not sure
strange vivid memories not sure if they are real
so being a working middle class mother of 2 boys i have prided myself of staying out of the system i became a mother at the age of 16 and since i did not have a legal guardian for myself i was not able to receive any type of assistance other than medical assistance by the age of 20 i was working a great job and dropped medical assistance fast forward 14 years and i am now an accounts receivable supervisor with a fortune 500 company i do my part pay for insurance keep money in a fsa account to offset expenses etc i also now have a 10 year old son i am currently separated from his dad who pays just enough child support to stay out of court but will not do anything to really help my 10 year old has been diagnosed with a sensory processing disorder it basically means he has heightened senses and so textures loud noises and such make him upset he is thought to also have odd and maybe some anxiety and depression the problem is that i cannot afford to take him to a doctor long enough to get an actual diagnosis due to the cost 35 co pay 20 co insurance his father will not sign off to allow a psychologist to actually see him as he feels that there is not anything wrong here s the problem my child is struggling in school refuses to do school work was held back in kindergarten due to not being mature enough for 1st grade and now he is a child that screams at everyone that looks at him or attempts to talk to him he has even threatened to hurt himself just this week not knowing what else to do i finally took him to the only insurance approved facility to handle children in my area they wanted him admitted immediately into either an in patient care or admitted into a partial hospitalization i agreed to the partial hospitalization as my son was able to articulate everything that happened and understand the scope of the situation i arrive this morning ready for his first 6 hour treatment only to find out that my deductible is not met because we have only paid the out of network deductible for his counseling this year i have a 20 coinsurance and the facility does not bill patients in order for my child to get the right help i have to pay 315 for the first day 300 for the second day and then 63 per day after that this is a minimum 2 weeks of treatment i do not have that type of money i have been on my own so long and started out in life by being in debt the sad reality is that if i would have not attempted to better my life and just would have lived the stereotype of a teenage mom my son would be getting the right type of help instead i am missing work praying i do not get fired and keeping knives hidden in my home tldr 10 year old has dark thoughts but due to a deductible and coinsurance that is unaffordable i have a child that is missing out on proper treatment

i have been doing almost the same job for the past 5 years first at one agency then i moved to a new agency about 5 months ago i have been incredibly stressed this year due to work load and pressure from my last agency i was having to stay in the office until after 8pm on many nights due to lack of staff i was generally the only one in my department it got to the point where i started drinking heavily and i then got big stomach problems mid way through the year by the time i was about to move i had really bad stomach problems and i had severe anxiety i was given 3 days off work in my first week and was prescribed anti depressants diazepam by my gp i hate the idea of anti depressants and refused to take them i was also referred to a gastroenterologist who performed an endoscopy and found my stomach was inflamed in summary i have been feeling incredibly stressed burnt out and unwell this year on top of this i have had a general fatigue i have noticed this is also causing problems at work as i am missing things making mistakes and my manager has begun noticing these and bringing them up i have now spent a while thinking about what to do and i have decided i want to hand in my notice take a month or two out to spend time with my family who i only get to see once a year as they live in another country and then go freelance afterward my question is though is there a good bad time to hand it in i want to hand it in this week if possible as i have a 3 month notice and would much rather be out by end of february my only concern is that i do not want to be seen as handing in my notice in the midst of me making mistakes in my head it will look like i am running away and i am worried it will make my line manager thing badly about me should i not worry about this and do it now or wait until the new year which will mean i have to wait until april to get time off tl dr i have been very stressed and burnt out this year along with mental and physical health problems i want to hand in my notice to take a few months off then go freelance yet do not want to make it look like i am running away after making a few mistakes should i just do it now or wait
should i hand in notice and not worry
so i was wondering if theres a possibility that i have depression for as long as i can remember i have always struggled with being happy or enjoying things my brain has always had this mental barrier that wont let me go any further then this mid point of numbness i have always thought maybe theres something wrong with me and its not depression maybe i am not trying to be happy or forcing myself to smile enough but i just literally mentally cant or do not know how to and even when i do smile it does not feel real even when good things happen to me my brain will do this thing where it will convince me it is not real even though i know it is but it does not care and i wont be able to feel good about it no matter how hard i mentally try i even get mental break downs of forcefullness to force my brain to be happy but it does not go anywhere i just give my self an actual headache or a feeling of tension in my brain area but when its negative things my brain believes it its like theres a barrier inside my head that i cant get past there was even a point where i wanted to be happy about something so bad that i started to literally bang my head with my fist to get my brain to work properly but the barrier is still there its as if my brain does not know what i am asking of it or as if it does not exist to my brain and the barrier is as far as i can go the numbness it feels like a part of my brain is missing or is not functioning its like trying to ask a computer to run a software that is not downloaded feels like i can actually feel the barrier there and it wont move no matter what this is whats leading me to believe i some sort of mental disorder and with the numbness being my highest mental point i thought being numb is being happy but the numbness does not feel good it just feels like a break from the lower mental points like just a midline that cant get any higher no matter what is this possibly depression i am thinking about visiting a walk in clinic in a couple days time after keeping this to my self for practically all my life p s i posted this on r askdocs for feedback but did not get a lot of responses was hoping i can get more minds onto this also i forgot to mention that i am suicidal but have not told anyone i have attempted suicide multiple times but always stopped when things got close its mostly because i start to get scared even when i know what i want which causes me to get very frustrated thanks for the help in advance
could this be depression
i ran out a few weeks ago and was wondering how quick they are i am feeling a tat bit low edit1 i am away from home and i cant see my gp about the meds or how i am feeling i am just wanting to know how fast they are at getting my meds to me
anyone whos from the uk use medcare to get sertraline
hi guys i am on this meds combo my doctor who is very old said i should not drink alcohol during the course of medication my friend s doctor said it is fine as long as it is not often not daily not every other day i know some would say follow your doctor but these conflicting advises bother me i am asking just as a form of survey i am not asking for opinion just your personal experience so here are the two questions applicable only to people drinking this combo 1 did your doctor tell you never to drink while on these meds 2 did you follow it if no did you have terrible side effects thank you guys if anybody s asking i am not an alcoholic i rarely drink i am just asking because i am going back to my hometown this december and be meeting with my friends who will almost surely ask me to drink with them yes i can say no but it is a culture thing so if i find out here that i cannot drink at all then i will not be meeting up with them
medication question sertraline and resperidone combo
ok so i am not sure if this is anything but for the last year or so especially the last few months i have just been getting more and more paranoid about things mainly people hearing me i cannot have the windows open in the house because i feel like the neighbours are listening to everything i do at night i have become really frightened literally lying in bed ears pricked incase anyone is in the house having to get up to make sure the doors are locked multiple times in the night my friends talking about me behind my back even though i know or at least i hope lol that they would not be it is probably nothing but it is just been getting worse and my dad has some mental health issues so i thought i should see if this could be caused by anything cause it is starting to effect my life also sorry for bad grammar and spelling if there is any on my phone and cbf proof reading edit i forgot to mention that going out in public has become a big problem in my life too i feel like everyone is just watching everything i do and that i just stand out so much forgot to mention it because i do not really leave the house anymore except to go get food which is a stressful time so it did not even really cross my mind haha

i am 27 and have finally decided to confront serious issues i have been ignoring for about 15 years when i was in middle school i joined a cult with my mom i moved away from my friends and the rest of my immediate family to a rural area with her and her abusive boyfriend who was high up in the cult i endured deep depressing years of solitude there where i developed a drinking problem at about 12 shortly upon moving back to the city i grew up in when i was 14 i started making some bad decisions and ended up being sexually assaulted by someone much older than me i then dropped out of school and my drinking habit worsened i started taking a large amount of drugs all my serious personal relationships went downhill and i spent my time on short personal and romantic relationships where i would not have to let anyone get to know me i eventually turned a lot of this around and went to college developed a meaningful career and got into a longterm relationship i tried to pretend none of the traumatic experiences were still impacting me last week i confronted my mother for the first time about the cult i told her about the sexual assault which i had never told anyone i realized how much of my life was still constantly shaped by those experiences for the first time in my life i am willing to admit the trauma from those experiences has fucked me up and i need to actually get help i recently moved to a new city and just got out of a five year relationship i want to find a therapist who can help me with those deep issues but also someone who could help me with the issues i am dealing with in my immediate life i have no idea where to start if someone could give me some advice on how to get started finding someone i can trust and who can help me i would appreciate it

where to start ever since i was a child i was always very lonely having come from another country i have no brothers sisters or family i could count on never had a best friend that i could spend my free time with and would be there for me when i most needed it i have had several friends over the years but something always occurs that make them become distance such as never having classes with them or just general drama where i had very little control since middle school one friend did remain and i hang out with him to this day during school he is extremely introverted and even through my attempts at reaching out to him to go places he refuses i have attempted telling him what pains me but he himself is akward about emotions and just makes a joke as if it will help me shrug it off i appreciate his attempt but i neeed seriouse advice now that i have stated just how lonely these past 18 years have been let me begin with whats hurting me first of all my parents have refused to allow me to go to any type of mental therapist something along the lines that they cannot afford it i once attempted to ask and he directed me to a family member whom of course i did not feel comfortable speaking to due to the relations my mother and father get extremely stressed when i mention that i am in any sort of pain last time i was in seriouse mental pain my mother fell ill simply from stress i am terrified to mention that i want to go to a therapist this year i began in my first real relationship and at first it was great because we were able to hang out often and she was very loving and caring however a little oblivious jerrica false name has practiced a sport all her life and after a season i found her rarely being able to spend time with her instead of 3 hours every day i see her every morning for 5 minutes then mabye another 20 during lunch after highschool it is very likely i will study out of state and simply the idea of long distance horrible cripples my heart i have felt so alone all my life and now after experiencing a slight glimmer of hope it is being taken away again she is hopeful for the long distance which only hurts me more the more i think how greedy i am being how i might hurt her how i keep hurting myself it just keeps piling on subconciouslly i look forward to college as an escape from this cycle but it is months away i am a senior and i am already in so much pain i tend to overthink things which itself might be a product of my loneliness and the fact that 90 of my afterschool life has been around the 4 walls of my room with my games and anime i have made great aquaintances i hope to keep good relations with untill i graduate but they are close friends with my girlfriend and i only fear i will lose this little peace at school and have it replaced with akwardness and only more loneliness all these thoughts compound in my head i try my best to not read into them and just be patient to see what occurs but i already feel so mentally strained i fear i have begun to fall out of love with her her pictures no longer stimulate any real response to me besides guilt the few moments i am with her i do tend to enjoy but now she has been taking less care of her looks and it only adds to my guilt of the possibility that i might not love her these doubts they are eating me from the inside i do not know what to do i feel i am being greedy but i still deserve peace i would like to think i do not have anyone to turn to please any advice should i bear the pain a little longer i have no shoulder to cry on no idea what to do someone please help i have not considered suicide but this itself feels like slow mental suicide i feel very fragile i am fairly new to reddit but i wanted this to be heard

hello everyone i have been on the same core medications lithium carbonate lamotrigine risperidone for almost a year now and have had great success with them i have switched over to the mail order pharmacy that my new insurance covers without thinking that they may dispense different formulations of my medications from different manufacturers than i am used to i received my shipment today and this is indeed the case all three have changed this may not seem like a big deal to most because in all formulations of a medication the active ingredient is the same but the inactive ingredients are not often the inactive ingredients including the delivery system of the active ingredient are very different this worries me because i had a very hard time adjusting to generic depakote when i was originally on name brand depakote having to go through formulation switches on all three of my major meds at the same time worries me does anyone have any thoughts or advice
rx formulations
i heard a male voice calling my name in a crowded hallway last week and posted about it on here since then i have heard the same voice calling my name again and saying i m in here from the heating vent in my apartment it was turned on in both cases it sounds external that is it is not a voice that i hear inside my head it sounds like a real person that is speaking to me and in fact sounds like someone i know which throws me off because i know logically that there cannot be a person in my heating vent i got in touch with my psychologist on campus after the first time hearing the voice and he told me to look for a psychiatrist through my student insurance the problem is most of the psychiatrists that i have tried to get in touch with are either not accepting new patients or they have a waiting period of 2 3 weeks i am worried about how this will progress in that period of time since i am already feeling a lot of anxiety because of both an increase in stress from finals and this new distressing phenomenon i am at a loss about what to do and having a hard time keeping things together any ideas about how i can intervene in this sooner rather than later

like when i sit still and think or watching tv or reading a book my hands will start picking pulling snapping and tearing anything around usually with a knife or some sort of pointed object a good example was my old bed frame it looked like it went through a tornado if blades from all the cuts scratches and chunks ripped out of the wood my personal body is a similar story but i am not sure if this quirk is related or not anyone know whats up with that or how i might be ables to replace and or stop it because i am worried about being at someone elses house and instinctively ruining their stuff thanks alot for feedback

it was 8am and i was on the bus to college i got a text from my therapist asking if i was ok to meet her today i replied with yes and thanked her for wishing me a happy birthday her text ended with an xx so i ended mine with xx too which she replied with a final x i got to the counselling offices early the room was felt small and claustrophobic all the seats were taken but one at the very end panicked and anxious i sit down on the furthest seat and look towards the wall for a couple of minutes until my therapist arrives to greet me and invite me into her office she stands tall the same height as me with black hair and hazel eyes she always dresses in colourful clothes and wears her hair down she has white sun kissed skin from her previous holiday to the mediterranean and always wears a smile on her face you can feel her energy happiness and warmth from her presence her confidence and sureness in life makes you feel safe in her company hi how was your birthday she asks in a warm caring tone it was ok i replied with my eyes glued to the floor i refused to look up it was like any other day my social anxiety ruled my life and she knew it too the conversation carried on for about 10 minutes until she brought up the courage to bring into the conversation how anxious i seemed i noticed you are being very distant from me right now is everything ok or are you anxious because it was busy outside it was busy outside i replied very anxious and stressed the conversation furthered until she began to ask mention how i barely ever look her in the eye uncomfortable and feeling vulnerable i keep my eyes on the floor as we discuss how when i feel vulnerable i look at the floor she tells me that the eyes are the doorways to the soul and that by not looking her in the eyes i am hiding my soul from her i felt very unsure however i agreed with her although i do not believe in souls i can understand what she means i feel there is something very warm about looking someone in the eyes something i miss deeply i explained how tense and vulnerable i feel when i look people in the eyes but she replies that it is ok if i dont want to look at her her left leg stretches out past the side of the coffee table i can see it in front of me as i am looking down at the floor it seems out of place and i am unsure why it is there i ignore it and look lower down at the floor i felt rude for not looking at her and how she had to mentioned it therefore i apologized it was just hard for me to look at anyone in the face she reminded me of the times i have looked at her in the past for just a glance however i told her that those times were always really short periods of time i struggled to hold it for very long without feeling uncontrollably uncomfortable she then tells me how she does not want me to miss out on life and that i have a future i should be enjoying it falling in love and being out with friends rather than being alone at home every day i agreed and she told me that she thinks i am a very sensitive person you re such a sensitive person she says in a informative tone i think being sensitive is a very good thing to be it means you actually care about other people and that is a good way to live i carry on looking at the floor and shrug i do not like it when a woman calls me sensitive i am a man after all it only makes me feel more pathetic but she repeats it nearly every session i think she sees it as a compliment however i feel very different on the matter as the conversation develops further it moves on to my relationship with my toxic friends i had previously been ostracized by people i have known for a year and it really upset me a couple of weeks back she told me just how honourable i am for not engaging in their childish games despite feeling angry she also told me she is never seen me angry but she knows i must get angry at home i tell her that is because i keep the anger to myself and there is no reason to take it out onto other people yet again she complements me telling me how grown up i am for not lashing out like the many others who have taken it out on me in the past the session ends 20 minutes after it is supposed to and i feel sadness not because she called me sensitive or because the session ended but because i have very deep feelings for my therapist i feel very attracted to her but have never said it she compliments me understands me and texts me on a regular basis i feel completely flustered by her presence i notice she sends me texts with x s in them and winky faces i also noticed the way she acts around me it feels so alien and strange i do not know if my emotions are viable or even if they are shared they are likely not shared however i have never had a person compliment me listen to me or seem interested in my life before my therapist seems so seductive without probably even trying i lay here in bed wishing i could tell her how i feel but i know she had reject me instantly therefore i never gained the courage to try i do not care what the world would think about it being unethical all i know is someone makes me happy and nobody else seems to care i feel incredibly lonely and only her company can make me feel happy again i live every day waiting for the next session each week the past few weeks have been very tough i cling to my therapist for a safety net of sorts i feel she sees me as maybe a son however i see her as a possible lover what a pathetic life i live
i am a pathetic loser and in love with my therapist
someone very close to me is really struggling to find happiness and i do not believe that i have the skills to make a long term difference i am just a regular guy with google but i had say that she struggles to some extent with low self esteem anxiety depression and codependency issues she has an alcoholic relative when i suggest that professional therapists could help her more than i can her objections include they ll just tell me to get over it the standard advice offered by her family i do not want my problems documented in somebody s computer or file cabinet i do not trust anyone else i cannot tell her to get lost when she needs my support but i really feel like we have been spinning our wheels trying to diy her mental health any advice that might help her sit down with with a professional would be very much appreciated

lawyers face much greater stigma than other professionals when revealing mental health or addiction issues
hey guys i am a 19 year old guy and i think i may have borderline personality disorder i am going to provide my reasoning and my plan of action and i had really like to get some input and advice basically what made me start to question whether or not my mental health was in a good place was that i would get pretty intense mood swings on a daily basis i would have feelings of intense sadness emptiness hopelessness but then someone would compliment me in some way and it felt like someone just stabbed me with morphine from insecure with thoughts of suicide to straight up cocky and grandiose thoughts also i am incredibly indecisive i will latch on to an idea because i am so sure at that moment in time that i have just found the answer to who i am but then i lose interest in a matter of hours days or weeks and then it is on to the next obsession life raft i am prone to reckless behavior reckless driving punching random things when i drink excessive amounts of alcohol extreme anxiety and dissociation am i on the right track here obviously i am no medical professional but borderline personality disorder seems to fit me like a glove when i look at common symptoms of mental disorders i am worried that this is just another one of my obsessions that i hope will fix my life but that is why i am going to try and see a professional once i am settled into my new base military like i said i would immensely appreciate some input

be aware that a lot of doctors do not have your best interest at heart
i have lost count of how many times my docs have set me up appointments after i am set to run out of medication because his her secretary cannot manage all their patients ffr if you give me 30 pills i am going to need to come back in 30 days or less it is not rocket science and when i tell the secretary that i am going to run out of meds before the appointment date she sets she just acts like it is nbd like there is no such thing as withdrawals i am on a daily 20mg xr dose of adderall and the withdrawals can be intense for the first two days you have interrupted sleep patterns like waking up every hour struggling to get back to sleep vivid dreams nightmares and general fatigue throughout the day then by the third day you get some serious depression and irritability you basically exist between the states of sad as hell and very pissed off what is even scarier is that while i notice the issues with sleep my family members are the ones who notice my behavior changes and point them out idk but that just really bothers me when other people are noticing changes in me that i do not even notice the same thing happened to me with the doc who prescribed me sertraline and those withdrawals were a lot worse but also less frequent i guess my question is this do doctors not understand how serious the withdrawal effects of the meds they prescribe are i have had two docs now that do not seem to have any idea that going 3 5 days without medication has a serious impact on one s life honestly i wish they had to take some of the stuff they prescribe and then go cold turkey off of it because then they had know just how crazy it can make you
rant do doctors not know wtf withdrawals are
i am 35 and never had any mental health problems before but yesterday i had booked a long haul flight to do some business a fair distance away eg 24 hours away it was a trip i was looking forward too i have never had any problems with fear of flying or anything i love travel on the day of travel i was getting really emotional at the thought of leaving my wife and kid but it started to get ridiculous i just kept thinking how unfair it was and what if something happened me etc etc ps i had her full support anyway ended up getting worse and worse until i cancelled the flight now sitting at home wishing i was there and wondering what the hell happened me and a tad embarrassed literally 5 hours of irrational behaviour as far as i am concerned and now i feel ok ps not particularly stressed at work only stress was a hope to get back in time for work in a weeks time was this a panic attack anxiety attack or what i got sweaty at times and cried a couple of times and had uncontrollable palpitations at times and felt warm all immediately relieved when i eventually cancelled the flight
panic attack or what
little background i am an 18 f and currently attending university i have never been diagnosed with depression but i always assumed that i had it i was bullied throughout freshman year of high school so i always point to that as my trigger for my flawed mentality i have always been a sensitive person in general little things constantly get me upset to the point where i will cry just recently i was trying to make a doctor s appointment but every physician happened to be booked for some reason when the technician told me this i quietly hung up the phone and started crying in some sort of defeat i find that i do this often with other random situations but i have no idea why i cry like this should i seek professional help to try to understand the root of my issues does anyone else find themselves crying over little things

american teens consume more illicit drugs than those in europe study
this was a problem for me a few years ago and i am worried it will become a problem again so i would appreciate thoughts advice if anyone has them so a few years ago i had a crush that lasted for several months my crush was the person i talked to the most besides family members coworkers etc but we were not very close they had a lot of friendships that were closer than ours whenever they did something that made me feel like they did not like me very much or they talked about personal issues online stuff like disordered eating self harm anxiety i would get really upset about it often to the point where i would self harm to deal with it i would feel like i had no right to interact with them because i could not help them or i would relate to how they were feeling and feel guilty over that or i would be afraid that their problems would make it harder for us to spend time together and feel guilty over that this happened several times over a few months and as i got over my crush it started happening less frequently until it stopped happening altogether now i have an online friend who i talk to pretty often but i am pretty sure they have much closer friends than me we met through a specific fandom and that is what we usually talk about sometimes this fandom can be hard for them to handle and they have taken extended breaks where they stop participating in it for a while and we end up not talking to each other as much when this happens i get really upset i have not gotten self destructive because of it but it reminds me of the crush i had three years ago i also feel like this when certain people do not come online for long periods of time i do not feel like this with everyone mainly with people i really like and admire the more recent feelings seem like they could just be me not wanting to lose my friends but i am still concerned that it could turn into a serious problem since it feels related to the crush thing i can manage my current feelings pretty well but i really do not want to get to the point where i self harm every time someone i care about posts something negative or does something that makes me think they do not care about me

when to seek help for a drinking problem
so this is going to be a bit of a long story so i will cut some corners for the sake of everyone s sanity the story starts with me getting a kinda crappy roomate he is incredibly annoying and all he does is play video games i am an incredibly tolerant person and help him try to fix some of his more annoying features cut to about 9 months later i move across country with my less annoying roommate to live with old friends me and my roommate i ll just call him tom get a job together in this new state we moved to after a while tom becomes worse off and my other roommates hate him this causes stress since i am always the mediator i should mention that i moved after losing my job and have pretty bad debt needless to say i end up falling for a coworker who is incredibly two faced she would say one thing to me and then manipulate the story she told to other people her backstory involved a lot of parental problems growing up now i am a very emotional person especially for a guy which is a byproduct of growing up with sisters and due to my weight problem and depression i have always been a social extrovert and continued to try to get this coworker over for parties before i knew what she was really like the irony is that she started coming over and going after one of my roommates as i was forced to watch her make advances on him not tom but another roommate and a childhood friend this of course was after her and i shared emotional thoughts and stuff so i was addicted to her at this point at this point in the story i hit an emotional brick wall due to stress of finances roommate arguments tom who at this point is unbearable and this coworker i had strong feelings for i could feel my emotions breaking under the weight of it all i lost a lot of weight quickly became cynical and more fiscally responsible somehow i had achieved everything i had ever wanted for myself as far as weight loss and fiscal responsibility go despite the depression i spent the next few weeks ignoring this coworker and pretending she does not exist i ignore her until she insists on having a talk with me she admits to me that she misses me and i have been mean lately and she has told me things she would not tell anyone else she says that our friendship is the most important thing to her she manages to sneak past all of my emotional defenses and start manipulating me once again this goes on for a while when i finally get so tired of everything that something breaks inside me and i have this overwhelming need to leave this is made worse by a party we have with my coworker and other friends the whole time i feel social anxiety something i am not familiar with and i just had to leave and felt so alone the party was at my house so i sat out in my car for hours on the phone with old friends i have never experienced any feeling like this before i have been depressed before but i am a social butterfly and love parties somehow i had developed a need to be alone something foreign to an extravert like myself within a week i moved across country again where i now reside with my parents while i get back on my feet all of this backstory is leading up to a question i have about my emotional wellness inside i feel empty not depressed or happy just like both emotions just are not there i feel oddly content overall but my social desires have plummeted and my parents and sisters think my behavior of going on random drives and talking to old friends for hours at a time are strange for me i find myself playing video games and having no desire to meet people i do have a job now but most people there think i am gay and i am fine with that so i have stood people up who i have met who want to bring me out drinking i find myself being a recluse and wanting to be alone i no longer seek women and typing this is the first time i have allowed myself to think about my old roommates in nearly a month is there something wrong with me i think i am emotionally or socially broken or something any advice or answers would be nice edit i should probably clarify that i am 100 straight i just dress fashionably for a guy so people assume
is this a bad thing
i have read the faq and it said i should seek out help if my problems stress me but these things do not exactly stress me but only after writing them down they do sound unhealthy a lot of my fears are laughable and embarrassing to admit i do have logic and understand that what i am doing is irrational and stupid but in the moment i am doing my stupid things i am not thinking that i am wondering that even though my small habits do not hurt me too much if i should still try and find help anyways to get some background i have been medically diagnosed gad i took medication for several years but it overall was ineffective so i stopped 1 1 2 years ago here s what is going on with my paranoia i check underneath my bed every time i enter my room to make sure nobody is hiding underneath there even though the space underneath is far too small for a person over the age of 5 to fit under i also check for cameras in my room in the shower i place a bottle over the black dot on the plastic curtain the one that keeps the water in in fear that it is actually a camera i will occasionally get up and walk around my room just to make sure nobody else is in there even if i have already checked i occasionally unplug my laptop and spin around so my back is up against the wall so if someone is in there they cannot see what i am doing and i will be able to see them if they move i will log out of skype for several hours at a time in fear that if i stay logged in my contacts may be able to see what i do on the computer screen watching porn is non existent in my world in fear of someone watching me i have difficulty talking to strangers online in fear that they are actually people who know me in real life who have tracked me down online and are just posing under a fake persona to try and get information off of me when i was visiting my grandparents this weekend who live in the country they have a big house with big windows and hardly any blinds i could not sit in front of a window at night in fear that i had be a clear target for a sniper or any maniac hiding in the woods with a gun that i could not see since it was pitch black outside at the same house i had trouble sleeping because i feared that the house itself was a clear target for any serial killer to come tonat night since you would be able to see the lights for miles on certain nights i keep my bedroom door open so i am not possibly alone in a room with some sort of maniac on other nights i keep my bedroom door closed so i am not open to any sort of maniac who may be outside the room i purposely sleep on my side with a thick layer of blankets over my neck so it cannot be exposed easily grabbed to anyone who may try to strangle me in my sleep those were the fears i could think of like i said most of these are just small bad habits i have i cannot even remember when they started but is it possible they can get worse if i ignore it should i seek help now
should i seek out help for this irrational paranoia
i am having trouble with remembering my emotions which include not being able to feel anything thinking back to past events i just get this nauseating feeling nothing more and it does not change whether it is good or bad memories it is not directly bad nor good since it does allow me to forget bad feelings simply by taking a nap but that is the same for good feelings i already have great problems feeling in general so when i do feel stuff it would be nice if it lasted longer than an hour is this normal i feel like i might be overreacting but i really do not know
cannot recalll or relive emotions

7 secret eating habits that may be signs of an eating disorder
i am 21 and male with bpd and i legitimately cannot get along with or empathize with anyone who is not also suffering from mental health issues when i try and talk to or befriend normal people i do not feel anything towards them at all legitimately nothing no attachment no sense of friendship nothing they just do not understand and all of their experiences feel so distanced from mine but while talking to other people suffering from mental illness i do not feel so empty anymore i can talk to them laugh with them and have meaningful friendships i have never had a relationship or anything because of these same issues regardless though i am at a point in my life where i feel very isolated have no one to talk to and am rapidly losing hope in ever finding anyone to talk to ever again there are no support groups or anything like that here so that is totally ruled out i just do not know where to meet people
how to meet more people with mental health issues
so i have suspected that i have some sort of mental illness for a while because while i am a generally positive person i constantly have these dark thoughts and feelings i am 16 right now and for while i have been having really bad panic attacks a few times the panic attacks in combination with the dark thoughts sort of built up inside me and it became too much after a lot of time spent convincing myself i told my mom about the panic attacks not the dark thoughts i am not nearly brave enough to speak about that yet and she said that we had ask the doctor about it the next time i had my physical i described to my family doctor what i had been going through and she suggested that i see someone better suited for this topic like a psychiatrist or someone who can prescribe medicine for this type of stuff my mom was there when i was talking to the doctor and after we left she asked if seeing a mental health professional was something i had want to do i said yes she then said she would look into it because she works in a pharmacy and has connections flash forward a couple months and my mom has not said anything about making me any type of appointment i thought okay maybe its just taking a while but i was close to hitting a low and i reaaaalllly wanted some help so i asked my mom and she said that she was still looking into it i got over my low and by this point i did not think my mom was in any hurry to get me to see a specialist and you have to understand that its not easy for me to bring up the topic i spend months going back and forth with my self weighing out the possible consequences so i was not in any hurry to remind her either then last year i hit a real big low i was kind of drifting in and out of reality and it was really scary i missed school for a few days and when i was not spaced out i was crying my parents were confused as to why i dropped the ball suddenly but i could not bring myself to tell them what was happening to me i just locked my door and hid from them all the ugly then i pulled myself together a little bit acted like it did not happen and you would not believe it they acted like nothing happened too i will say that my parents love me and my siblings very much i know that for sure but i am just not sure if they think its a phase or what i have always hid in my room when i feel any of the ugly coming out some maybe they do not believe it because they have not seen it i do not know but i do know that with every day that passes by i get more and more tired out waiting for help to come i have almost given up on asking for it my heart feels so heavy it hurts and i am almost physically being dragged down i am a good person a straight a honor student a cheerleader and an involved member of the community i know i have potential but i feel so burnt out what can i do to fix myself
please give me some advice
i am a freshman about to go onto the 2nd year of college i do not really go out of my way to ask for help and i do not know the reason why i am doing relatively well in school but not as well as i should be most of the time i just go out with friends or game excessively and i do not think about college that much i am getting pretty hard classes next semester and i am not even sure if i am going to be able to apply because i do not know how to apply for loans my friends know me and envy me for being calm and unstressed all the time but honestly just checking the college emails or going on the site to check for work or extra credit gives me the worst feeling ever the work is not hard i just get like that and i hate that about myself typing this makes me feel like a piece of crap but idk i do not know what is the deal with me and why i am like this i am smart i guess but i make the worst choices and i rely on my emotions and act on impulse i do not sleep enough and i do not do what i should to take care of my body i do not even know where to begin

i guess i have a bit of a story i had like to vent out trigger warning i guess i might seem insensitive or whatever to mental health issues block of text also incoming some backstory on me i suppose i used to think i was gay but over the past two years i am something more like pansexual i am out of the closet i guess but it is not really a fact most people know about me or would guess when i told some close friends nonchalantly they thought i was kidding story time there was a girl i dated for about two years and it was sort of on and off during that time her names not important privacy and such sometimes i broke up with her sometimes she broke up with me but we often kept together very early into the relationship about a month or two in she told me that she had a mental disorder called dissociative identity disorder i never really had a problem with it and thought that it would definitely be wrong to break up with someone because they had a disorder she had one alter who really just hated my guts and did his best to make me miserable but a lot of the other alters are people i had call my friends i never really thought that anything was wrong with her her having the disorder and alters was just kinda part of her i guess there was nothing else really wrong with her from what i could tell and i really liked her much later into the relationship she told me that when i asked her out she was suicidal and thinking about ending it everyday and that me appearing in her life had saved her i motivated her to be a better person to try and get a job to try and get her ged i also began to notice her panic attacks her overuse of pills and how she was when she did not have any she clinginess and other problems she has a really really hard life and she had always come to me with her problems to talk i never knew what to say i am really horrible at dealing with bad important things and am really bad at advising them all i could really say a lot of the time was that i am sorry when things were rough i had spend entire days trying to make her feel better by showering her with compliments reading up on what i should be doing and trying my best to emulate that and just in general working hard to make her feel better as i mentioned though her life was really hard i had be trying to make her feel better almost all the time and it was exhausting i had go through periods of my own hard times and i could not talk to her about them because she had it so bad for that reason i broke up with her a few times as previously mentioned eventually though she had seem better and i felt less exhausted and bottled up and she had ask for me to take her back and i always did after a few of these occasions and her breaking up with me too though i made it a rule in my head that we should stay broken up if it ever happens again about a month ago now i had say i decided i have been unhappy for a very long time all i feel is anger when she talks to me because of the exhaustion i mentioned i ended up breaking up with her but we remained friends i think she is overall just a very unhealthy person for me to date i still felt or feel things about her i do not know if its love i do not know what that feels like at all i guess i suppose i love her i want to hold her i want to make her smile i want her to be happy i want her to be mine but she started dating and made a tinder account literally the day we broke up and instantly appeared happier once again she bragged a lot about all the guys who thought she was so attractive and how she was going on so many dates that made me really angry i think it was jealousy mostly because i still do feel things for her two weeks later she begs for me to take her back i don t i asked for her to stop talking to me about who she was dating and stuff but its all she really talked about anymore she often did it in roundabout ways like coming to me for help coping when her mom called her a slut for getting a hickey on her first date with someone today she told me about her fucking a guy and i just got so angry i did not act on my anger i never do i just sort of bottle it up and feel it inside me whenever i am alone i decided i need a break from her to sort out my feelings and told her she freaked out on me and sent about a half hours worth of insults i do not know i am just very angry and sad whenever i am alone now when i am with people it is great but alone i am suffering i find it pretty hard to open up and pretty sure i do not really have any friends that are close enough to me for me to tell all this i do not even know what i want to hear back at this point from you people
i have been very angry recently do not have anyone i think i can talk to
my mom has been treated for chronic pain with opiates for over a decade i know that sentence alone raises a lot of flags but her spinal column was damaged in a car accident causing her to have two back surgeries including a fusion and is legally disabled she has also always been consciously aware and afraid of drug addiction she has never allowed her doctors to raise her doses however she just started this whole i have a parasite infection thing obsesses over having pictures of them has now stopped going to two doctors that told her she was not infected just paid to have a bunch of lab work done with no results and gets very upset and angry when someone even begins to suggest they are not real at first this really scared me but yesterday i googled her behavior and the description for delusional parasitosis is spot on to the tee i am actually somewhat comforted that she is not losing her mind and that this is a known side effect of opiate use i just do not know what the hell to do now and i am still very scared worried for her

i have had a lot of trouble with school work and studying these past couple years and i feel like it is getting worse i want to schedule an appointment for a psychologist or psychiatrist but i need the emotional support and insurance of my parents to do this i have very briefly mentioned that i think i might have adhd to my mom lack of motivation procrastination etc but she thinks that since my grades are alright that i am fine i hate how i barely finish assignments on time and how i cannot even sit still and study and this is going to get worse as college progresses even just thinking about doing assignments fills me with dread even though i know i can easily finish the assignment if i just sat down and did it but i am unable to just sit down and do it she also has said that her brother has adhd and my dad shows symptoms of it sometimes but i know he is not diagnosed so my final question is how can i confront my parents to say i think i need an appointment edit my parents just got home and my mom asked me how i was doing on my paper i have 1 page done out of 7 i said i do not know what is wrong and of course she just tells me i am being lazy and need to just sit down and do it this fills me with so much disappointment in myself and i have no idea what to do help

i am 24 and i have never had a girlfriend and i am honestly certain i am one of the most naturally unusual looking people i know my jaw is sunken in on itself which creates an awful squished effect where i have a disproportionately giant forehead but the bottom part of my face is totally shrunken and squared off it gives my face a very underdeveloped lopsided look i have asperger s and i am pretty sure my features are indicative of a developmental disability i went to a hair stylist to get a pretty expensive haircut but i feel like i still look like a total autistic loser my head is shaped in an extremely weird way that no style would look good on the pictures where you can see my whole body show how disproportionate i am people i know irl tell me they do not see anything strange about how i look and i am average looking not attractive or unattractive but i think i look awful every time i look in the mirror and it drives me insane i have posted on r amiugly and most of the people tell me i look normal but a few people told me i am ugly and they seemed a lot more sincere i have tried buying new clothes getting a nice haircut and none of it makes me look any better lipstick on a pig etc i have never benefited from the dating relationship advice i have read and i feel like it is not written with people like me in mind i am not too bad at talking to men but when i talk to women in any setting they seem awkward and uncomfortable i have posted about this before but i am feeling really anxious because i met a girl who i think seems cool but i am worried that if i talk to her she will just think i am an ugly creep how do i deal with it pics of me since people do not take my word for it
i am very strange looking and i have no idea how to deal with it i am afraid to be around other people and i have never had a girlfriend how do i deal with this pics included
i feel like i have to make a choice regarding what kind of person i want to be i recently went off fluoxetine and went on to seratraline the problem i had with fluoxetine was that i suspected it was making me feel unmotivated and emotionally numb it is early days with the seratraline admittedly but so far i have seen no change so now i am wondering if i should come off drugs completely but i am worried this will send me back to square one when my intrusive thoughts and anxiety were at their worst i also fear i may end up like i was before extremely oversensitive and emotional to the point where even the slightest negative comment towards me would hurt my feelings to but it basically i am torn between caring too much and not enough while i am here i also have some other advice to ask how can i stop being so self obsessed i am very self aware which makes it hard to socialise naturally ironically the more i worry about how i behave around people the worse i behave it is also just a headache frankly despite the fact i realise this i cannot seem to shake it off because trying not to be self aware is of course a form of self awareness in and of itself it is like saying don t think about elephants you cannot think of anything but elephants any advice

i have been consistently tense and restless for 5 moths and have trouble sleeping and reaching an orgasm i have talked to psychiatrists and doctors and none of them have an answer as to what is going on with me it all started when i was prescribed depakote risperidal celexa and abilify 5 months ago and a few weeks later these symptoms started i am considering asking my doctor for a referral to a neurologist to see if they can help me out
can somebody help me out
i mean i am a nice person i say good morning to strangers i say thanks for people who have thankless jobs i smile for strangers i will do any favor i can to make you happy but sometimes it is all just so heavy sometimes i just get tired of being good sometimes i just want to see the world crash and burn and see it all end in flames sometimes to implode everything to make the world feel as i feel inside because my heart is just so heavy and i do not even know why
everyone gets tired of the world sometimes
i am 20 and i just got my first real job at a dollar store it seems so insignificant and something i should have done a long time ago but it is a huge deal for me i had to work up a lot of courage for this a couple of years ago i had trouble asking for an extra ketchup packet my first day was on black friday and a 12 hour shift to boot while running the register i felt like every customer spoke a language that i only vaguely understand i ended up making a couple of pretty big mistakes luckily my manager is really awesome did not write me up and found a way to fix it she said that it was kind of their fault for starting me out on black friday yesterday they put me on freight they said it was because they figured i would be nervous but i really think they were afraid i would mess up again i did not mind freight does not talk so it was more comfortable to do i just cannot help but feel like my managers regret hiring me over someone more qualified i kind of lied on the test i knew i was not good in social situations but i would not get a job at all if i said that i really need this i really need the money and if i stay for 90 days i am eligible for dental and vision insurance which i do not currently have but need i just do not know if mentally i can handle it i hope it gets better i kind of feel like i need to see a professional but i am not totally sure of my insurance status come january i might not be covered and i definitely cannot afford it out of pocket i guess i am just looking for support if anyone would like to recall their first few days of work or just offer words of comfort i would appreciate it advice is appreciated as well thanks
i got a job but i am not sure if i can handle it
okay so back in april i gave myself a commitment to achieve to eat right quit smoking and work out for 180 consecutive days in a row including weekends no breaks in mid october i reached this goal but since then i have started to struggle started eating shit again not as bad as i used to but still not good only been making it to the gym a couple days a week i got really bummed over a girl a while back and once i made myself reach my promise point it is like i allowed that disappointment to finally kick in so now i have been drowning in depression struggling to keep the gym nutrition routine going kind of lost as to what i do about motivation i have some pretty difficult depression issues so some motivations will not work i am sick of living so alone though i feel like maybe i had be more motivated if i had something to work towards my confidence was raising but were shot down and reversed when things did not go well with that girl i like i get stuck on these things that adults usually don t i missed a stage in my childhood i think anyway what can help motivate me books i am kind of lost on the amount of protein i should be taking as i am trying to gain muscle and lose fat at the same time even emotional suggestions could help t hank you for reading
here i am now motivate me
a couple of years ago i went through a period of 6 days in which i was completely and utterly anxious and upset to the point of not being able to function i could not go to work i could not sit still i could not interact with people i could barely eat i could not even watch tv or switch on the computer the only thing i did was lay in bed and cried and the only thing that made me feel somewhat normal was going for a long drive i do not know what it was and it lifted as suddenly as it started it was 7 years ago and never happened before that or since i went to my doctors during it who gave me anti depressants but i never took them i did not feel depressed and they said it would take a few weeks to kick in but i felt i could not wait that long instead i spent time talking to the samaritans to feel like i was actually doing something to help i thought things like this occured whenever something bad has happened to someone or it is a reaction to something that happened however my life was great i had a great job that i loved i was with friends all the time my family is wonderful and i had no stresses and the biggest worry i had on my mind was where me and my friends were going to go on a friday night to this day i still wonder what was happening is it possible for someones brain and mental health to go just completely haywire for no other reason than it can
is it possible to have severe prolonged anxiety panic without any external causes
i live in a foreign country and do not have anyone to talk to where should i look for help online

so this girl is the love of my life incredibly easy to talk to and i have so much in common with her however she recently told me about how she regularly has thoughts of killing people hears voices and wishes death on her mother admittedly her mom is kind of a crazy bitch but i do not believe anyone deserves death she said that that is not even the half of it but she is improved since then she also told me about experiences where she is blacked out and gotten incredibly violent she claims these episodes have not happened since she was in high school however just a year ago she practically raped me held me down against my will and would not take no for an answer it got to the point where i started yelling at her and hitting her not violently do not want to seem like an abusive ass i could never harm anyone to get her to stop but no matter what i did she had a smile on her face after a while she came to and proceeded to cry and tell me stories of her blackouts including destroying rooms and at one point in her life strangling her dog didn t kill it just hurt it regardless not okay but she says she does not remember that happening she has this thing of repressing all of her bad memories to the point where she cannot remember them anymore i told her she should talk to a therapist about it but she is afraid she will be admitted and she does not want to have to rely on a pill to survive or be normal she out right refuses to go i do not know what to do guys i do not want to break up with her but at the same time should i stay with someone in an unstable mental health like on the surface she seems normal however she started telling me all of this last night and it really unsettled me i have kind of just ignored it until last night when i learned her wanting to murder her mother was genuine and not just her in a bad mood she says she would never act on it she says it is a way for her to let off steam by fantasizing about it still though does not seem super healthy to me tl dr should i stay with someone if they are mentally unstable and refusing to get help even i love them
so might be severally mentally ill and i need some advice

i want to be numb to life i want to be emotionless and cold i do not want emotions i do not want hate love or any of that shit i am tired of life and committing suicide will not solve anything because my soul still lives and god the shitty bastard who created me will judge it i am sick of being good for no reason i am sick of the fact that our world still exists so what can i do to spiritually mentally and emotionally to corrupt myself being sinful sounds like too much work just as much work as being good how can i force my soul to suicide

i am not going to tell you that i have adhd or anything other than what my dr told me a few years ago i was diagnosed then with depression anxiety i was prescribed effexor xr and it is really helped but i am still having very specific problems that i find extremely exhausting to try and tell anybody about i cannot commit myself to anything i can read a book but that is about it if i am not doing something different every ten minutes i have a new hobby every one or two months sometimes every couple of hours i am not having any problems with suicidal thoughts but i do have general feelings of unworthiness i fight sleep because i feel like i am just wasting time i should also mention that i am prescribed klonopin which helps me in social situations and makes me sleepy i sometimes cannot stop talking though not incoherently i just talk sometimes i cannot work myself up to even say hi to my dad in the morning and will not talk all day then at the flip of a switch i will be in a talking mood again i am not a very sad person just sometimes i am intensely interested in something then i am intensely disinterested in everything i love my wife and my children dearly and i know that i am hurting them when i go into my hiding hole and will not talk much i hate myself for this and i know how hard it is for them i need something to constantly keep me going for instance when the cubs were on their world series run i was great that whole time and rode the high off of the win for a while then i was back to normal me i have never been through anything traumatic was never abused never did drugs except painkillers and weed for about two years the painkiller use was light i do not even like alcohol i am an empty person inside not a psychopath i feel intense affection for my loved ones but it is showing it that is the problem i can show it to my wife and children but that is it not even my own brothers i cannot even tell them i love them and they have never done anything to hurt me i have no love for money or power i do have general and consistent interests baseball specifically the cubs jesus christ i m not hearing voices i am a true believer of jesus and attend a very loving and helpful church that has helped me pipe tobacco and hearthstone in bouts but then sometimes i just lose interest in it all i literally want to sit in a chair and stare at a wall sometimes until i fall asleep i want to take my day off monday which is my optional scheduled day off but i cannot make any decisions and try to pressure others into making the decisions for me a very nasty trait of mine i just do not know what is wrong with me but i know something is i am not out of touch with reality i just feel like i have no identity or long term goals or motivation i am afraid to see the doc because even though he is a wonderful dr i am pretty sure he will just think i am under stress i m not and up my dosages writing this made me feel better i know it is a bit rambling and whiny but it helped to show how much different my mood will be tomorrow i would not be suprised if i just deleted this whole thing as soon as i wake up i just need input advice anything i am sorry for taking so much of your time but i am so grateful you lent it to me
really struggling and at a loss here
hey i have been having a lot of mental health problems since the start of this year and have decided i should probably see a doctor but as the waiting list is so long wondered if anyone would be able suggest what i might have so i can maybe get some short term relief or at least an understand how to cope i was diagnosed with anxiety at 9 and depression at 14 and have taken meds for years but this is quite a separate problem symptoms hearing do not hear people talking directly to me or long delays in understanding and responding hear noises that are not happening e g knocking on doors running up and down stairs creaking of doors occasional nonsensical voices feeling dazed confused foggy detached from current situation hard to maintain a conversation severe trouble maintaining one line of thinking feeling of flatness as if everything is happening very far away or is muted touch often a loss of sensation in fingers e g if i was not looking at my hands i would not know i was touching something if i close my eyes i feel as though i am floating and become very unsteady a lot of brain fog simultaneously lack of boundary awareness never know if i am standing too close or too far away from someone because everything feels like it is miles away anyway memory hard time remembering to do things i have been asked e g at work school often cannot remember how i got somewhere what i was doing or what i was thinking about very bad memory often repeating things many times over because i do not know if it is been said or done have to ask many times what needs doing and will need recapping a lot large gaps in memory both long and short term often unable to categorically say something was real or definitely happened so yeah any insight into wtf is wrong with me would be really good cos this is really starting to scare me feel as if i am genuinely loosing my mind sorry if any of this did not make sense but coherency is not a strength rn tldr feeling spacey af hearing noises awful memory cannot tell what is real and what is not anymore
any insight into what this could be
i have got a lot going on in my head and i had like to be able to sit with a therapist once a week and be able to talk about my past and also some of the feelings behaviours i am struggling with presently do i need to get a diagnosis from a psychiatrist first or can i call a therapy office and just walk in ideally i had like to not be diagnosed with anything due to stigma i live in ontario canada for reference
do you need a diagnosed mental illness in order to access therapy
i grew up in a very conservative home and there were plenty of things i reasonably did not like but the problem is that i have always wanted to do the exact opposite of what i was taught even things that were very appropriate i do not know if i have ever 100 thought for myself this epiphany happened shortly after moving away at 19 there were not anymore restrictions and it gave me the opportunity to finally begin finding myself on the side though i feel so sad and angry i was so focused on being the opposite of what my conservative family believed in i wanted to make sure everyone knew i was obnoxiously opinionated narcissistic and a liar trying to make everyone believe the picture being painted these realizations were beneficial as i began to learn from my mistakes but now at 21 i am incredibly insecure about myself before leaving home i did have some friends but it took me moving away to realize they were assholes who used me and made fun of me behind my back trying to avoid any experiences like that to happen again i always remind myself not to be too nice to people and to be neutral unless the time and the place calls for otherwise but i have developed a lot of social anxiety being around people because all i have ever been was too nice to everyone so i spazz and it is like i do not know how to even act around people which makes my peers in my new town which is supposed to be my fresh start think i am weird do not take me seriously how do i love myself when i have lied to myself for the first 19 years of my life
how do you learn to love yourself when you contributed to everything you were against your whole life

need help figuring out how to help a loved one
i have severe social troubles and anxiety i used to think it was just social anxiety because i am so afraid i cannot even make myself talk but at times i am reminded why i ended up in that state of mind and it is basically because i tend to lose myself or sort of my composure when i do things when i am observing signals are mostly clear to me like what people say what it means you know cognition but as soon as i go and use my body somehow or talk it is like something motor skill related happens and a second or two after i am done talking and this is almost every time i realize what i have said after i am done talking but not as i am doing it in short i find it incredibly hard to use my speech as an action because it is almost as if i can only think one thing at a time i cannot hold legit conversations that follow a chain of logic where you argue back and forth even knowing how arguing works in theory because i do not have a good sense of myself in the second i am talking but only afterwards i am able to process what i just did and i mention composure because this also extends to physical things i may play around with a ball or play guitar i am good for maybe the first 5 or so minutes but soon i lose composure and get reckless sort of if it is guitar i may start missing all the cues all of a sudden even though i did excellent just moments ago and if it is physical activity i may get so immersed in that thing i am doing that it starts looking weird from the outside people may think it s too much and i can sense that as soon as i fade back into consciousness a second after i am over it i do not know what this is i have sometimes thought it is like dysparxia could also be adhd of some sort i hope it is not aspergers i have been this way my whole life did not realize how far from normal i have been until the last couple of years of my life closest resemlance i have seen out there is probably thom yorke from radiohead something about his performance is a little freaky as if he lets himself get carried away until his facial expressions look really strange and he starts shaking his head too much from rhythmically appropriate to erratic and that is a good example of how i feel when i do things it makes living hard because with social anxiety that stems from that and being judged for all my mistakes i feel like i have to tiptoe about everything when i am around people and i can never just do something the way i would do it becuase i fear people will find it to look or sound off putting due to my lack of composure
i lose self consciousness when i do things i think it is a motor skill problem
just a heads up this is mostly a rant and will probably end up turning out really crappy and poorly written let me start by saying that almost everyone in my family has some form of mental illness i received my bipolar disorder and some anxiety issues from my mom as well as recent signs that point to developing auditory schizophrenia all of my other relatives three brothers and a sister have one mental illness or another it is considered more strange to not have one than it is to be completely crazy my mom grew up with three sisters and two brothers her father was abusive and her mother was purposely oblivious to my grandfather s actions he was only abusive towards my mom which caused her to develop many of the phobias and mental issues she has now when she married my dad and became pregnant with with her fourth child my younger sister my grandfather had threatened to kill her when she was born but he died before she was before my youngest brother was born five years after the first four of us my mom was admitted into a psych ward after having a mental breakdown they proceeded to try to make her better by using shock therapy but it did not help much she was released and continued to raise us she did her best at being a parent but she was far from the perfect mom one of the things she had the most trouble with was seeing if something was wrong we all went through phases when we were young where we would lie or do things to get attention but i was the worst i will willingly admit that i was a little asshole when i was a kid i would constantly lie about almost anything to get attention to the point where my parents started to think i may be a compulsive liar when i was ten i was molested by the sixteen year old brother of one of my closest friends and told my mom even though he threatened to kill me if i told anyone instead of trying to help me she yelled and grounded me for a month for lying about something so horrible i may have lied about almost everything but i never lied about anything like that looking back i do not blame her for not believing me if i was her i probably would not have believed me either she did the best she could with raising five psychotic little monsters and dealing with a recurring alcoholic for a husband shortly after her and my dad divorced my mom decided she wanted to go back to college she was already in her late thirties and still had my youngest brother to take care of but she had been going to college to become a nurse before my first brother was born and wanted to go back now that all but one of us was out of school she started out at a new college that i cannot remember the name of but eventually transferred to kettering college a school that my great aunt works at and helped her get into she had been working hard and was making it through her classes until she got to algebra no matter how hard she tried she could not get get a passing grade she did the class over to the point that she had to start paying out of pocket to go to the class again a week before thanksgiving she met with the school counselor to talk to her about taking the class again because she had to send a request to take it again to whoever is in charge of that stuff the counselor talked to her about it and told her not to lose any sleep over it since she was confident that she would be accepted into the class since she had high grades for all her other courses she asked my mom if she had any health issues or anything and when she found out about her many mental illnesses her attitude towards her completely changed she started talking to her like she would snap at any moment and like she was dealing with a spooked animal two days before thanksgiving she met with two other women who work with the counselor who told her she had been denied the chance to try taking the class again they proceeded to tell her that due to her grades being low she would not be able to take any of the main courses at the college all of her grades were the highest you could get for all except algebra they treated her the same way the counselor had treated her she is now trying to figure out what she is going to do now that she is been told she cannot come back i have tried to tell her she can always go into phlebotomy since she passed the course for it but she does not know if she will be able to since it is been a while since she took the course when she first started at kettering college i was skeptical they are a seventh day adventist based school and we are catholic they are extremely closed minded about mental illnesses for a college for becoming nurses and doctors i have seen people with worse grades and attitudes about college that are given better treatment because they have no health issues and follow the same religion and this is where my rant ends i am not really sure how to end this since i have not actually written anything like this before so i am sorry if it kind of sucks i just needed somewhere to rant and get this out
my mom was kicked out of school for having mental illnesses
as the title says i restart everything i do most of the time without even finishing it first i do this with games a lot and with books both for academic and fun purposes sometimes when i do this i catch some questions drifting across my mind questions like am sure that i understood that i should go back what if i missed something what if am reading too fast what if at the end of the book i did not understand what the autor tried to say if i proceed i will remember this part of course anxiety rises after each one i do not know if this even has a name but any help would be appreciated thanks
i restart everything games books etc
i met this guy not too long ago and he is honestly everything i had look for he is sweet to me and those around him if not a little shy and easy to talk to has a generally good personality the whole good shebang the only thing is i have officially had severe anxiety and mild depression since my junior year of high school i graduated this last june my anxiety affects me much more on a day to day basis and when it comes to people i talk to everyday like this guy i just have to be able to check in from time to time because i establish habits quickly and worry regularly about them we have already established we really like each other and we both know about our mental illnesses and are willing to try a long distance relationship as we live in different countries for now the distance does not bother me as much but of course some days are not good days for him and those days my mind goes into hyperdrive because he typically wants some space and that is fine but that disrupts my being able to check in to make sure he is okay if there is anything i can do say to distract him or anything like that i guess i am afraid that it will become too much to handle for us despite how much we like each other he tends to shut down on his bad days but growing up i have been forced to pretend everything s okay and then word vomit what is in my head the few i feel comfortable with but he typically does not like heavier serious conversation from either of us so he either ignores it or tells me it is too much to talk about so i feel like it does not matter even though i know that is not what he is trying to convey any advice general or specific i mean i could really use it
i have severe anxiety and mild depression ought i date someone with moderate depression

my mom has struggled with depression and schizophrenia since she was in her 20 s she is 74 now over 50 years of fighting the demons within but she is never given up and through all of it she is the kind gentle woman i remember and love from my childhood did she have bad days bad months even bad years hell yes literally hell when the voices in your head are so strong that you ask people around you if this is real am i making sense you know it is getting bad when she tries to talk but she is in so much mental anguish she can barely push out the words and it sounds like someone is pushing on her lungs so hard she cannot get a deep breath it is bad but then she breaks through on a better day and she is calling me to ask me how i am doing she is writing letters to family and friends to encourage them she is pushing herself to be a helper in any way she can even in the confines of her senior s home and she is never lost her faith sometimes the angels she talks to are not real but there are days i have to wonder if her connection is not stronger than i might ever know she is amazing because i think most people would have given up years ago but she won t because she is my mom and she is a hero do not give up my friends there are people who are looking up to you even as you struggle on
you know who is a hero people who deal with big mental health issues every single day for decades and win

so i think this is important i got hit by a car today nothing really serious just a sprained ac joint but still i got hit by a car and yet i could not stop thinking what a great day it was my depression has been pretty well in check and i realized everything is better than depression and it is shitty because when i was depressed if i said i was depressed i tend to get less people who give half a shit than saying i got hit by a car even if i emphasize the minor nature of the accident but depression is a shitload worse than being hit by a goddamn car and i think most people do not realize that and i am not saying depression needs boatloads of sympathy but i am saying that people need to take it seriously hopefully this gives someone a little bit of perspective maybe it is because the extraordinary circumstance of being hit by a car catches your attention and because depression seems so nebulous and seems so hard to distinguish from just being sad but less people think you are okay when you get hit by a car than when you are depressed and i can say from my own experience that i am unequivocally less okay when i am depressed than i am after i went head over heels thanks to a careless driver tl dr i got hit by a car getting hit by a car is better than depression

i had a manic episode and bought a car i can afford the payment but not the gas
this is seriously fucked up and i am having a horrible time processing everything so i kind of just wanted to vent yesterday i went to pick up my friends at their apartment and found their neighbor hanging from the railing of his balcony it took me a moment to even process what i was seeing i dialed 911 and then ran upstairs to get my friends there was nothing that could be done it was too late after the longest 5 minutes of my life the police and medics arrived to secure the area and get him down his kid came home shortly after that crisis workers came to the apartment to debrief with us about what we had seen and offer support i had a plan to kill myself three months ago to the day and had gotten about halfway through the pills i was going to take before i realized that someone would find me and their life would be seriously fucked up i went to the hospital spent a week in the psych unit on a 2 md hold and 2 months of day hospitalization i have had a long history of major depression anxiety and ptsd i know how it feels to be at the point where you have to end the suffering i feel for him but i also feel a lot of anger toward him and feel awful for feeling that way if i had not found him it would have been his kid or the lady downstairs who opened her door to see what all the screaming was about and found this guy literally hanging a few feet from her door i see his dead face everywhere i cannot sleep i cannot eat i see his fixed blown pupils on everyone i do not know this guy and he is everywhere i do not know how cops ems personnel deal with shit like this on a regular basis i really don t how do you get through trauma with prior mental health issues

i have borderline personality disorder and i have heard so many times people warning others to stay away from people like me we are total psychos crazies fucking mental i have seen so many times people writing that i do not deserve love respect or even a right to live this is exhausting but i am not that we are not all psycho stalkers or manipulative bitches and i believe even them have the right to live yes our illness does not excuse the abuse we may commit not at all and you have the right to hate your ex who manipulated you but remember that when you say don t date people with bpd you are also hurting innocent people who happen to suffer from the illness i always try to see the positive things even in my illness i may experience sadness or anger in an extremely intense way but i also experience happiness in a way few people will and i have a lot of empathy so much it can be funny sometimes but it is getting so hard to stay that way when so many people are reminding you that you are worthless because you share an illness with their ex or mother again i am not a stalker and i try my hardest to not manipulate tho i will admit i sometimes do without realizing i really try so hard to recover to not be an obsessive abusive bitch as so many people have called me i am just an 19 y o girl who sometimes stay up at night in order to create a whole new languages because i am feeling happy and motivated and who will choose the saddest looking plush to make it happy and it is unfair for you to tell me that i do not deserve love or that i should be euthanized the you refers to the people who have told me this shit not to the people reading this you are probably a nice person you who are reading this

should mental health issues be discussed at school

i will leave this here
this sub is a big source of fear and anxiety for me the reason is that the general attitude is that mental health professionals are always right no matter if they are not helping making things worse or abusing you people who have been horribly abused by mental health professionals are usually told that either they deserved it or that that is just how things are because more or less crazy people do not matter i understand that this is not the sub for us to sit around and say everything is shit constantly and it helps people a lot more to say here s what you can do to fix your situation feelings rather than just do not do x but when people post here complaining about being mistreated or abused they should not be treated like their experiences did not matter the thing is that there are so many gaping holes in the mental health field people who need help are falling through the cracks and people who need specific care are getting a different kind of care that makes things worse and people who are people and deserve basic human rights are being treated like prisoners for no good reason we as a community need to address these problems not sweep them under the rug or make excuses for them they re professionals they know what is best is not the appropriate response for someone concerned about being forcibly drugged or someone who was verbally abused by a therapist or someone who has experienced something horribly traumatic at the hands of professionals i say this because i was abused by mental health professionals multiple times i have ptsd and this leads to lot of crippling fear and paranoia i cannot be treated for it because my fears are rational and all of the decent read not throwing things at clients not cussing me out for crying not violating hippa law etc not just the people i agree with therapists i have seen about it say that there is nothing they can or will do to try to make me stop having rational fears you know what sucks pretty much my only option is either to off myself or to drug myself to the point that i do not even know who i am anymore just to make the fear stop i do not want to do either of those things of course but those are my options you know what sucks worse that i come here wanting a community that will understand and agree that clients deserve a voice in their care and get shat all over of course this is not everyone but it is a large enough portion of this subreddit that people pm me saying that they agree with what i have to say but are too afraid to comment because of the hostility some members here so yeah that is why i am unsubscribing

am i a sociopath psychopath
i said to my gp that i had taken various online questionaires and many had shown high probability of a mental illness he essentially told me theyre all bullshit and lies i mentioned to a nurse when i had my assessment that i had be doing research and believe i may have bipolar or a personality disorder i still believe and all he said was that i had been self diagnosing and it was likely normal teen mood swings sometimes i feel like the best thing you do is find out yourseld what the problems are but medical proffessionals dont seem to like being told they like to do it themselves and then get it wrong because they assumed a picture that wasnt true appararently i dont need help from an eating disorder team because i had felt more improved the days beforehand when really that was hypomania and a few days after i went right back to anorexia esque behaviour fuck doctors they listen to the things they want to know rather than tackling the big things you want them to help with
why do doctors seem to dislike any form of productive self help

9 bad habits that impact mental health
so i m black and over the past few days i have seen and heard of more shootings i just do not understand why it is so hard to see why black people are hurting there is always an excuse they should not have done whatever it was stalled in the middle of the road waited for their son on the bus run away lay on the ground with their hands in the air complied it just feels like there is nothing a black person can do to prevent being shot by the police although the police have no trouble de escalating situations or bringing in white people who give the police an even harder time and no all police are not bad cops but they become bad cops when they fail to protect people from other bad cops why is that so hard to understand honestly what is the point of living if i can get pulled over and end up dead seeing cops make me shake i am so fearful but angry at the same time is this ptsd i am definitely depressed and i have to go into these spaces filled with white people for school for work and nothing no discussion about what is happening in the world nothing i am walking around on edge tearful and heartbroken and someone is asking me if i watched the fucking emmy s have you seen the fucking news am i not supposed to care or be hurt when people are dying that look like me and the only common denominator is that we are black i am probably going to get such a negative rating for this but i do not care you are killing us physically mentally this shit affects our mental health constantly being demeaned and told that your pain is invalid is the most isolating fucking thing in the world and this shit hurts like hell
white people make me feel like i am going crazy
this is mostly just a vent as i have never actually had someone i could explain everything to but i would not say no to any advice on how to deal with this that does not treat me like i am some serial killer bent on filling the horrific void in my soul with the screams of children firstly i do not want anything relating to sociopaths on any sort of medical record so i have never bothered to get officially diagnosed however it is definitely something to do with emotions and morals i have a very difficult time internalizing morals and normal emotion an example would be if i saw some sort of news report on a shooting in a mall i had understand people are going to be upset but i feel nothing of the sort and i do not understand why people are upset an example of how i fail to internalize morals is that objectively i know something like let us say cannibalism is wrong i have no desire to eat someone because i see no point but if it ever became a necessity i would not hesitate as i do not really get why everyone is against it as much as they are i do not think i am fully sociopathic though if that is what is going on since i am pretty sure i can feel affection i am dating a guy right now and i honestly think i do love him unlike all my former friends i am not sure i could just cut off all contact with him and move on with no regrets as i have done before i also know i seriously lack empathy i can fake it to an extent and i know when i am supposed to feel bad for someone but the emotions just never come to me and i hate trying to comfort people since i find it very awkward and boring to fake caring but at the same time understand i cannot just go i do not care and leave them alone i have never felt guilty about lying to people that i can remember even my current boyfriend though i very carefully never do anything he had be furious devastated about if he caught me lying as i know guilt would never drive me to confessing is not spared from how i lie even when i am caught any regret i feel is usually over being caught and wishing i could go back and change how i lied so as to avoid it i am pretty good with knowing when to not talk about something at my office i know not to talk about all the creepy murdery things i have seen online and i never mention how i do not get why everyone is upset over some dead people but faking normalcy is exhausting and a huge reason for why i am so anti social and anti interaction since i have to work so hard with maintaining an air of sanity i am always exhausted about social interaction which has led to me dropping out of two separate colleges within the first week of term and i try to shy away from anything involving spending a lot of time near people which has definitely made my life difficult i would truly love any advice on either how i can deal with this without having probably going to totally be a serial killer in my medical records or ways to better understand internalize emotions and morality

tinder is bad for your mental health say scientists
i am not sure whether this is normal for a girl her age i know most people going through puberty are insecure but i feel like this is starting to get unhealthy and i want to end it before it becomes too much of a problem she is 12 years old and underweight for her age she gained no weight between two gp visits which is worrying she s going through her growth spurt she has voiced her concern at a number of occasions about how she thinks he is fat ugly ect however she will often ask my dad if a certain bit of food will make me her fat what made me worried enough to post this was when the topic of gaining weight came up again i asked her how she felt about it and she said i am fat i then asked her if she felt hungry which she said was a lot and then i managed to get her to say that she felt good by not eating this is scaring me she seems open to the idea of gaining weight for now but i am not sure how long this will last i feel like i need to stop it before it becomes a complete compulsion do you know how i could talk to her i know that saying you are not fat will not work or convince her and for most people its deeper than believing you are overweight possible causes could be that she has very few friends scared that people are looking at her at school and sometimes afraid of going to school due to teachers being loud she has senstitive hearing or some unnamed reason bullying may not be out of the question but i have asked her and she hasmentioned nothing
i think my sister may be developing an eating disorder
i am afraid that the girl i have been dating for almost a year might have bpd borderline personality disorder i am very frustrated and need someone with experience on this topic to help me out couple of days ago i felt that my relationship with my girlfriend is getting worse as she tries to unknowingly but intentionally abuse me more often her mood swings really badly and can jump from bad to good in just under 10 seconds literally she often insist and persuade me to do the things she does not really want like meeting up later due to inconveniece issue and when i finally accept it its a nightmare as i mentioned earlier these symptoms are getting much worse recently so i went on google in search for some of the possible described condition she might have i started on a website that wrote people with these abusive behavior may develop or already have bpd with examples of the general behaviors people with this condition have at first it was unconvincing but i still read on and also researched on other several pages because the more i read the more i feel there is some similarity i took an online bpd test and answered all of the quizzes using my knowledge of her behavior and the result was 34 severe her symptoms that i know of that are similar to the ones listed on the pages i researched on are as follows extreme reactions including panic depression rage or frantic actions to abandonment whether real or perceived she had tried to break up with me at least 2 times a week for couple of months for weird reasons like she behaved badly i will probably leave soon anyway so she will be the one the make the move or somewhere along that line this went away because we had an agreement a pattern of intense and stormy relationships with family friends and loved ones often veering from extreme closeness and love idealization to extreme dislike or anger devaluation she always fight with everyone she is close to including her best friend her mom and me she once broke away from her best friend that she idealize so much for months just because her friend did not give her enough company that she did not ask for distorted and unstable self image or sense of self which can result in sudden changes in feelings opinions values or plans and goals for the future five minutes everything is fine ten minutes later and it is a freaking mayday one day i can play video games in front of her the next day i get mad at just by telling her that i will turn on my computer recurring suicidal behaviors or threats or self harming behavior such as cutting i saved her from suicide once or maybe twice not sure if this is the case intense and highly changeable moods with each episode lasting from a few hours to a few days this one is dead on chronic feelings of emptiness and or boredom she does not say this out as often now as we have an agreement going on but before the agreement she always say things like everyone is against me i m so alone nobody understands me everything is so empty etc when she is in the anxious or depressed state of mood swing inappropriate intense anger or problems controlling anger she often blame the weather for this because it is always 30c here but again weather should not be the reason she gets mad at me having stress related paranoid thoughts or severe dissociative symptoms such as feeling cut off from oneself observing oneself from outside the body or losing touch with reality when very stressed or anxious he often lie in bed saying the keyword that got her in the mood over and over again with her eyes wide open unstoppably creeps me out big time now to the real question 1 are her symptoms likely to be bpd is it just me or is it other condition 2 if she has to seek professional help how can i convince her to do so she instantly go off when i say she needs help from a professional and inisist that she is fine 3 would these symptoms come back again after treatment sorry for the ridiculously long thread i just hope someone may be able to help me here i am genuinely very frustrated
my girlfriend might have bpd needs experienced advice

here s my most recent piece i posted about my personal battle with an eating disorder feel free to read it
long story previously i have posted in fair detail how i have been struggling with my bipolar ptsd and gad being so out of control that i am on short term disability and fmla concurrently until now there was otherwise radio silence because i went to a private mental health hospital that also offers out patient services to hopefully enroll in an intensive outpatient program things did not quite go according to plan after my intake evaluation they thought it was best to admit me as full in patient i was experiencing symptoms of psychosis and apparently a concerning amount of suicidal ideation mostly i consented for medication management purposes as i said i was discharged a week later to pick up partial patient care the next day from there everything went south i asked my mom to pick me up because i genuinely wanted to see her she apparently thought i was asking because my boyfriend who tries to avoid driving due to too many traumatic car accidents did not want to come get me she called him and ripped him a new one for a solid 20 minutes after she picked me up she decided to lecture me that i deserve better than what my boyfriend has to offer me i tried explaining that without his support in all meanings of the word emotional mental financial etc i would not have made it as far as i have she told me what we have is no more than a business arrangement and compared my year and a half long relationship to her 16 year one which is just unrealistic i was completely blindsided by this because she has never had an issue with him before so i think she just had something going on herself but when we got to my apartment and it was messy but within my regular standard of living admittedly lower than hers she continued her lecture and made sideways jabs at my boyfriend who was present but not participating because it was a family matter and would have made a long term problem my twin sister who lives with me has an estranged relationship with my mother and our relationship was only functional because she owes me for rent and stuff the only reason she lives with me is because my mom turned her back on her anyway my sister put herself in the middle of the argument the two of them are just fuel to each other s fires and i kept trying to send my sister away but she kept coming back at some point my mom started recording everything so she had some indication that things were going to get ugly but did nothing to defuse the situation eventually the situation escalated to the point my sister came storming out of her room and threw two pill bottles at us and said i took 13 of each so i tried to send her to get room again while my mom dialed 911 she refused and said she was leaving so i blocked the door so she tried to jump off my balcony but my mom pulled her back my mom yelled at my boyfriend to grab her but i told him to let her go and i ran after her i followed my sister for a half mile before i lost track of her but was able to flag down one of the cops looking for her and provided her last known location the whole walk home i did not know what was happening and if she was found when i got home my mom hugged me and the first thing she asked me was you know what this is do not you i was and still am furious with her she nearly lost a daughter and i my twin sister and the first things out of her mouth were vindictive and accusatory then she shot my boyfriend a death stare to which i called her out on between her and me he is responsible to answer to me no matter the stakes at that time i dismissed myself to go inside but my mom insisted i stay outside with the her and the officers i was confounded and asked what could they possibly need me for mind you at this time i had no idea on the situation with my sister so i complied to give my statement at that time then they finally told me they had my sister and she was cooperating so my sister was at the hospital demanding my mom acknowledge her mental health issues as seriously as she does mine while in the same breath refusing to be med compliant so the behavioral health unit refused to accept her in their wing then she goes on facebook and twists her story to make it sound like her attempt was related to a trauma she suffered three years ago which obviously is not the case i full heartedly believe my sister has borderline personality disorder i had to make the hard decision to immediately revoke my sister s and my living arrangement and she is no longer welcome unless she is gathering her things and either my boyfriend i are present from a therapeutic standpoint i am processing everything well so i do not have regrets about my actions and i recognize the stages of grief as they come and go but i know i am traumatized still so i am am frustrated i am going to therapy i am going to group therapy and all that good stuff but there is just no stopping this process so i am at a loss of what to do in the meantime
short story on the same day i returned home from a mental hospital my twin sister tried to kill herself so i kicked her out of my home
i have been getting more and more frustrated with the amount of knee jerk ableism that seems to have become engrained into popular language i know that 90 of the time the people using these words do not know the connotations regarding what they are saying however each and every time i cringe at the least and sometimes actually get pretty offended some of these words and phrases are used so much on a day to day basis by not just my friends family and coworkers but in the media as a whole news books tv shows movies it is everywhere i am not going to list them all as you all know what i mean but how do you deal with it do you bring people up on it and try to educate or are you not as upset by i as i am and leave it aside and not let it wind you up anyway thought it would be a good conversation what have you got to say x

i have gone to two walk in doctors to try to get some anti anxiety meds i have mentioned ativan because i hear it is the easiest one to get since it apparently does not have the same history of abuse like valium and xanax and apparently it is not quite as strong as those either the first doctor i saw just laughed at me for even asking but before sending me on my way he suggested i take some antidepressants and gave me a list of ones to consider and told me to come back once i have decided on one that i felt the most comfortable with of course i left and did not come back the second doctor i saw seemed more sympathetic and asked me more questions i did not mention ativan because i was laughed at the previous time and i did not want to just come off looking like i just wanted drugs cuz i did not want them to think i just want to abuse them instead i just used the term anxiety meds he ended up referring me to a mental health clinic and gave me a prescription for escitalopram aka lexapro cipralex i threw the prescription out because i do not want to be on antidepressants i was under the impression i was going to be sent to a psychiatrist but apparently i just ended up seeing a counselor at the mental health clinic i have seen him several times now and it basically has just felt like a waste of time the only reason i have continued to see him is because he set me up to see a psychiatrist through the clinic i saw that psychiatrist today finally and talked about a whole lot of stuff first focusing on my anxiety then delving into my personal life and upbringing although i feel like i was very clear about my anxiety i feel like i kinda hit a wall with him because he seemed to think that drugs were not the best thing for me at least not benzos he seemed like the kind of psychiatrist who is very careful with prescribing drugs but he still thought it was not that bad of an idea to represcribe me escitalopram i feel like he was concerned that i was going to be using ativan too much even though i made it clear that i do not get anxiety attacks that often like once or twice a month maybe even less however they are horrible and can go on for hours so i wanted something so that i do not have to experience and anxiety attack anymore i made it clear that most of my anxiety is social anxiety and i made it clear that i can deal with most of it even though i do not like it but there are situations like making important phone calls or job interviews etc where my anxiety it too strong that i usually just avoid those situations thus do not get ahead in life so seeing as i am not in those situations on a daily basis and often not even on a weekly basis there should not be concern for me overusing them and getting addicted i feel like he somehow thought that i have more general anxiety that is quite constant but i don t for the most part i am quite relaxed on my own or with friends and even though i feel a little anxious going shopping or working i can tolerate that anxiety and would not consider popping an ativan in those situations i was super clear about the frequency of my anxiety and what situations i feel like i could benefit from a benzo and how i feel like many situations i could manage the anxiety without anything anyways that psychiatrist was apparently just a one and done type thing apparently i most likely will not seem him again and quite frankly i do not really want to felt like a waste of time he got to know very personal things about me things even my family does not know and although he seemed sympathetic i do not think he actually understood my anxiety in that short session apparently he and my counselor seem to think i am doing great just because i am currently working however it is just a seasonal job that i have been working for the past 3 years and my anxiety prevents my from finding work in the off season thus i am not moving forward in my life i do not think this is acceptable for a 25 year old male and it blows my mind they think i should be proud of that sure it beats not working at all but it is hardly something to be proud of another thing i gathered from the meeting was that girls tend to acquire benzos more easily than men they did not admit to being sexist or anything but when i mentioned that i know numerous girls who take ativan and one who takes klonopin and all they did was see a random doctor and yet i have gone through all these hoops and still cannot get ativan i also mentioned that i have read on this subreddit about how people have gotten benzos quite easily they admitted that men tend to have a harder time because it is assumed they are more likely to abuse a drug i could not believe it when they said it it was so damn sexist but being my quiet anxious self i did not speak up about how ridiculous that sounded anyways i feel like i am back at square one apparently the psychiatrist will send records of my visit with him to my family doctor he said i could see him and ask about ativan he did say he was not going to recommend it in the letter however he was not going to discourage it either he figured it should be totally up to my family doctor i do not know if it is even worth it because i feel like it is gonna be the same bullshit all over again and i will probably leave with another prescription for antidepressants now that you know my story and i thank all of you who read it all or at least read enough to understand my situation do any of you have tips on how to get a benzo prescribed to you also are there any other young men out there who have struggled to get a benzo like me has anyone else noticed the sexism or is this just my own personal experience my counselor claims that you cannot just anticipate an anxious situation and pop an ativan and that it is only to stop an attack once it starts that does not really make sense to me and the people i know who have ativan say that they have taken it before job interviews before and it takes most if not all the edge off they also told me that it is bullshit when a doctor tells you that you cannot function properly on them because many people can apparently get away with a pretty low dose that gets rid of the anxiety without making you feel super sleepy and useless i understand you are not supposed to use a motorized vehicle even if you feel like you could do it the people i know who use ativan from time to time have taken it at work before and have been able to do their job just fine do any of you feel like you can take a benzo ahead of time when you know you are going into a situation that causes anxiety attacks and it works for you i do not get random anxiety attacks much anymore and even when they were frequent it was only like several times a month but now it is like once or twice a month at the most but i can often go months without them if i am put into certain situations that cause strong anxiety i can still have an attack though but most of my daily anxiety is manageable and i do not need pills for it i just want pills as a back up for those times i have attacks cuz they are fucking awful and i do not want to experience them anymore

as someone who has personally dealt with another person who has bpd i have a question the person i dealt with always lied to me about every freaking thing and whenever someone calls her out on her bullshit and confronts her when she is caught lying she flips it around and tries to make it sound like the other person is bad and as if she is the victim when she is not i know it is said that it is part of bpd but it just sounds like a psychologists passive response to a grade a asshole my best friends mom worked in a mental institute and told me she had gladly take 10 schitzophrenics over 1 person with bpd i have to say i agree with her the girl still comes into my workplace even though my husband and i have told her to stay away from me my managers are not consistent with telling eachother to keep her out and the police did not take her harassing me seriously because she is a female not a male double standard right if she were a he harassing me and getting her friends to do it for her then she would have been arrested she and her friends have been trying to find out my work schedule and finally found out when i work her best friend would come into the store without her and beg me to be friends with her it is creepy and sounds like she has a big lesbian crush on me which i do not doubt because she is sexually confused and has also made false rape reports on guys the problem is not as bad now as it used to be we act civil to one another when she comes in and i keep blocking all her extra facebook profiles i am like how many fucking e mails does this bitch have so nobody took it seriously not even the cops just me and my husband and my mom did i am looking for work somewhere else but i cannot switch just yet and almost everywhere is hiring only part time because the companies do not want to pay insurance so i am just staying there for the insurance at the moment so i guess my question here is why do they lie and act like victims when they are not saying it s just part of their bpd does not tell me much i guess i need a deeper explanation she is like an emotional vampire so i act like she does not bother me when she comes in but she does i want to have the upper hand on understanding her mentality i feel if i can do that i can control my emotions better i feel that despite how well i act she may still know how she makes me feel

first off i realise that some people who think that antidepressant are good might feel that this post would be harmful should anyone take it seriously but i believe that antidepressants are harmful and i have some experience with depression and antidepressants admittedly i am just one person and i am sure there are plenty of large scale scientific studies support ads but i want to share my personal experience my experience with depression has led me to believe that most of the time depression is causal from your situation rather than there being something wrong with your brain this is not just based on my own experience i think most people who suffer from depression do not openly talk about it not because they fear stigmatisation but because they do not want people s pity but when i started discussing ads with my friends i was so surprised how many people said oh yeah i was on those were you on ssris when i asked these people about it more it was almost always because of a break up or a bereavement or some other issue they had e g body image issues in my case it was a lack of agency when i left school and got a job my depression faded it is not gone it is a part of my personality but it does not ruin my life anymore it is now even perhaps a source of strength i feel like i have developed coping mechanisms that help me deal with shit that healthy people who have not been through the same hell lack i still have to stay on my toes but i do not embrace depression like i used to when i was severely depressed and i realised that drinking half a bottle of whiskey everyday was not a great idea i went to the doctor i got the 10 point questionnaire and was diagnosed and given a prescription within 15 minutes i took ads for a short amount of time some months i cannot remember exactly i will admit that i went into it incredibly skeptical and i was thinking about the placebo effect often now while i will admit that this skepticism could have caused a negative placebo effect what occurred to me was that all the side effects that the drugs had might be crucial to the placebo effect assuming with my skepticism that the drugs have no real therapeutic effect i have read that sugar pills that i really big or brightly coloured have a much greater placebo effect i think that the dry mouth low energy and lowered libido give the sufferer evidence that the pills are doing something even if the only real effects are negative i wanted to give the drugs a good shot despite my skepticism i was desperate so i stopped drinking when i started taking them this is something good that came out of it even though it did not help my depression but i think that i could or should have been able to give up drinking on my own or by some other method that was not potentially dangerous i still drink now but i do not have spirits in my house and i will sometimes go days without drinking that is the anecdotal part but i also have some philosophical insights something that kept running through my head when i was depressed was that i was broken i think that taking ads only goes to serve this cognitive misappropriation while medicalising something that is so painful and so all consuming is simple and comforting i do not think that it solves the problem and could even make it worse while there are definitely some medical conditions that cause depression as a symptom depression itself is not a disease in the same way that alcoholism is not a disease if you look at the amount of people who are diagnosed with depression i do not have the exact numbers on me but we both know that it is shitloads what are the chances that a figure like that is accurate and it is a figure that keeps rising even with the increased use of the drugs that are supposed to stop it if you are in that group consider the possibility that in this case the medical consensus might be wrong you are not broken now i know how palpable the pain and fear are when you are depressed but when you are cut it is not a disease but it really does hurt the pain is real and the pain of depression is just as real and perhaps worse but the source of the pain is a cause the cut might be from a thorn and the depression might be some trauma or some kind of affection you were deprived of but it will heal of course first you must remove the thorn and this is alot simpler in the physical world however if you agree with me that depression is causal and the cause is some shitty aspect of your life you do not necessarily have to take any actions at all i think that positive action is good but you can also change your perceptions of things with no effort whatsoever you can decide to stop being afraid or at least take the first step and decide that you do not want to be afraid anymore you can decide to get up and walk around the block just once you can decide to help someone when you recognise that your depression is causal and not because your brain is broken i think you will feel a significant sense of power over your destiny you will deal with the bereavement you will get over that break up and if you just have a shitty job then at least you know that the problem is that you need a more fulfilling job even if you cannot leave that job because of your responsibilities at least you know that there is not anything wrong with you anyone with your intellect would be depressed in that shitty job either change it or change your perception of it the challenge is identifying the cause which is not always apparent i do have some thoughts on why depression is getting more prevalent is today s civilised society but i realise that this is already way too much text and that few people will read it edit paragraphs
why i think antidepressants are bad
today i heard a woman was raped by a man in university of british columbia i wonder if she is a client of the mental health team will they tell her to compassion to him because he is sick tell her the world is not fair anyway tell her to forget about it tell her that she alone is responsible i do not know however the mental health team told me all when a woman has been harassing me

since the onset of my ptsd symptoms i have received many suggestions from doctors to try cbt if i hear one more person suggest cbt i am going to scream cognitive behavioral therapy is just one of many types of therapies it is based primarily on restructuring our thoughts and behaviors to make us feel better it is widely touted by doctors as being proven or evidence based this is primarily because it is one form of therapy that is easily measured this does not make it good some things are easy to measure like things that come in finite quantities and more abstract things like relationships are not so easily measured please understand that there is a major benefit to insurance companies for endorsing cbt because it is a short term therapy that can be delivered in a group cutting down on costs for them many doctors will recommend cbt even if it is not what is best for the client please do not do cbt just because it is the first thing offered if it is the type of therapy you want to do then by all means try it i did a cbt workbook years ago and i found it really helpful but if you want to do long term therapy or more in depth therapy or if you just want someone to listen to you without judging you do anther type of therapy get the type of therapy that is best for you and if your insurance does not cover it say something because you should not have to suffer just so they can save a buck
cbt is not for everyone

hi all i have a question about a past roommate close friend she recently was hospitalized for messing up her meds but another friend roommate found out that she intentionally tried to hurt herself which led to hospitalization she is doing much better now seeing counselors and neurologists to take care of herself and generally seems happier when we hang out and more at peace part of this is probably because she broke up with an ex apparently this ex threatened to have her committed when she started to break things off my friends and i all agree she is in a much better headspace right now from what we see and that his tactics seem downright abusive is this something we should really be worried about he keeps lingering around her facebook posts and all and i want to tell her to just cut him out of her life if he causes so much stress but could he really have her committed my friends and i can definitely testify to her being in a much more stable place now and she lives with 3 other roommates who can attest to that as well we are in the us for reference thanks for your thoughts and advice
question about a friend and her safety
i am currently 18 and i had quite a strange experience when i was 11 13 and i still do not know what it was so basically there was this period in which i had too many thoughts i remember standing in the bathroom for half an hour while the shower was running with a bunch of thoughts another characteristic was that i always had to finish it that is what was causing the delay it was very annoying i also have ocd btw so sometimes i couldnt start a new activity before finishing these thoughts i still have ocd but i dont have this thing of finishing the thoughts taking hours an abundance of thoughts so the thoughts they just kept coming i cant even describe it anymore i just remember not being ablet os leep because there were so many thoughts calling my mom during break because i couldnt stop thinking and it was distressing me i dont remember much except for fragments like me being in art class and asking my friends all these weird questions of life i remember they did not really understand me and i felt frustrated but it wasnt like oh whats life in the philosophical sense it was more like why the hell are we here i dont understand my consciousness how can you do these trivial tasks without having these thoughts what are you doing i thought they were the crazy ones i also remember having a very strange moment in which i felt like i had taken over the old me like i was a bad me i also had all these dreams about demons and woke up in fear once and i kept thinking i had a bad spirit in me it was very strange ok i still feel like i didnt describe the abundance of thoughts well its not like youre thinking a lot in yourself after a long day its like you cannot do anything else because they keep being there and also new ones keep popping up at every loose string so for example my thoughts would actually keep going off on a tangent in a way that just wouldnt happen now or for you guys like oh there was this book 10 mins of thinking about this one thing and then coming back to the main thought also another thing was that i had to recall exactly how i came on a certain thought another thing was that i was afraid that if i didnt have a certain thought do a certain thing it would change how events would be another thing was that i remember this before the storm broke out it was summer and i movd around the house while watching a show or something and i started telling myself i had to recall eexactly where i was in what order i was even asking my mother repeatedly where i was just before just to make sure that the order was correct it was very strange i think this is when it started since although i still have to perform rituals remember stuff daily this was much more obsessive it was all consuming literally i felt like that was my only goal to retreive those steps it was almost as if it was haunting me ok last but not least in that period ifelt disconnected form my parents i kept thinking why do i love them theyre just arbitrary people i also felt like nothing pleased me anymore even eating pasta or watching a movie or something everything felt goalless i kept on trying to find a goal i would eventually like or something to keep myself busy with explain why this was happening to me but i just couldnt and in that period i spoke to some friends again disconnected to reality i know this because i said some very very strange things i would never say now as you will see soon i said stuff like that i was having too much thoughts like i felt there was a demon in me a friend told me recently how much i had scared her this was years ago i wonder why she remember but whatevs i came up to her at the end of the day and said mary i havent given you a kiss this morning so give me a kiss we always kiss each other in the morning and she was really freaked out so basically this is just ocd right this had to be done and wasnt done for the day except i would never do something like this now ie trespass the boundary of involving other people in it and she said i looked absolutely crazy and not like myself ok i think i am done now i just want to know what was this btw there are some other important details i think i have left out but i have already written a lot for reference right now i am pretty normal ihave ocd still but others dont notice it i love my family well not rationally but i am not desensitized to them i still have pleasure i am going to study next year there was another period in my life around the time of earthquakes in japan that was also very strange and much scarier i actually think i may have mixed up some events but basically the too much thoughts thing is period i ok lol i sound crazy just tell me if you recognize anything i would be so glad if someone has had a similar experience btw i absolutely dont think i am schizophrenic or whatever i have never heard other voices or people inb4 you should not seek diagnosis on reddit i just want to hear some pointers experiences and i will in no way use this to diagnose myself i will probably visit a therapist about it soon
any idea on what this was too many thoughts desensitized to everything obsession with useless things
so i recently moved from texas to washington state i have ptsd i never had to register my dog as an esa whilst in texas because my landlord did not have any issues with her she does everything an esa does do accept i do not have her officially as one right now she is stuck in a humane society waiting for the word for me to have her transported but this landlord says that i cannot have her even as an esa and that the owners of the property will drop their insurance simply because years ago some guy was not paying attention to his akita and it bit a kids face off so the leasing company got sued is there a way i can fight to stay where i live and get my dog here any advice will be helpful i do not want to have to get another dog i miss my girl so much it is actually causing more stress
if my half pit bull halt black mouth cur is my registered esa can my landlord deny her living with me
about a year or so i worked at this call center it was a really crappy job basically to take calls from people enrolled in this benefits program that had all kinds of flaws that could not be fixed people would call in and be really nasty to you and you just had to sit there and take it there was this guy that worked there named jeff they had me sit with him for a couple weeks of training jeff seemed really normal he kept his cool with really annoying customers and made small talk with me about his girlfriend hobbies pretty regular stuff sometimes we would make fun of the customers in between calls but it was all in good fun anyways fast forward a few months and i am done training i still see jeff around the office we make polite small talk once in a while one day i am sitting there in between calls and i hear really loud obnoxious laughter i look over and it is jeff he is standing up at his cubicle laughing like a maniac everyone now is looking at him a supervisor went over and asked if he is ok and he just started laughing louder she started telling him to sit down and that he is disrupting everyone but her pleas were ignored he just kept laughing louder and louder finally security guards walked in and escorted him out of there nobody ever saw or heard from jeff again as far as i know anyhow i always suspected jeff had just had enough of his job and did not know any other way out i know he was not crazy who knows maybe his gf cheated on him or something like that and he lost it but it was just so out of character this guy was like the last person i would think would have a breakdown like this does anyone know what happens to people that do something like this do they go on some kind of government assistance i know in the old days they would throw you in a state hospital with the padded walls one more thing to add i do not think this guy drank or did drugs there was no reason to suspect that at least regardless of if he was faking i felt really sorry for him he was a pretty cool guy and this job fucking sucked hard so i could not really blame him if he was
have you ever thought someone was faking
i am a 19 year old male and for the past year or so i have gone through cycles of depression i feel that i most closely match the symptoms for manic depression or bipolar disorder as i go through periods of intense highs and lows right now i am in a very deep low and there is nothing that seems able to pull me from it i am thinking it would be a good idea to get on antidepressants to help level me out any advice edit i have never been on antidepressants or any mood changing drugs at least prescription mood changing drugs

how is trump affecting our emotional lives
i just left a psych ward a week ago i have been kept there for a month i am not going to disclose why i was there i am asking if i can sue the staff for how i was treated i was involuntarily committed and i had to sign paper work that would ensure my 72 hour surveillance and they would release me based on my behavior i was being non compliant only because i was treated poorly i was forced certain types of medication i was kept longer because i had a fight with the nurses at 3am they enforced curfew at 12am and i chose not to listen but that did not give the three women the right to pin me down i am a man but one of them was large and the other two were about my size i weigh 170 and lift and these women were not only rude but were surprisingly strong
vent i cannot get over being put down sedated at the hospital i cannot do anything about it
i have lived with my parents for practically my entire life and i am 28 i have developed an eating disorder that has crippled my ability to digest food i have experienced extreme desolation and loneliness for years and all the depression and anxiety that is been a part of it the thing is most of my trauma is non specific there are not really any specific events which it derives itself from it is more of a deep alienation from humanity over a long period of time i have had a little trouble with drugs with lsd and marijuana and i can definitely point to some of the bad experiences on both those drugs to affecting my mind states and i have had a couple experiences with other people that i might be able to say were traumatic but not in a really concrete or definite way what has been almost most traumatic is the reaction to the trauma my eating disorder was violent and pretty disgusting it involved lots of binge eating to the point of agony but never any vomiting the details are horrifying probably to most people that is not familiar with this kind of stuff and i am not going to go into them but i can say that this was also a kind of trauma because there is no traumatic event my life over the past seven years has been a blur splotched with nightmares i am not by nature a very apathetic person and i love laughing and enjoying life but i think a lot and a lot of the world really depresses me but i have essentially been depressed for all my adult life actually some of the most painful experiences i can remember are during my travels i have done some hitchhiking through the us and slept wherever i got dropped off some of the nights usually half sleepless were extremely painful and lonely hitchiking itself is a really painful experience to go through because the mass of cars that pass you by and the lack of humanity really got to me it has really scared me i am just trying to understand how this works in healing it because it is so vague and non specific i know that all i need is some love and to be able to share something with someone in a mutual way but i am not sure how to go about that i have had counseling before but i cannot afford an actual therapist and actually i am not very interested in one right now at least i just want to be able to start recognizing the symptoms of this trauma and how on a daily basis i can begin to work through it
i just realized i have experienced a fair amount of emotional trauma
so i have no idea how to help my girlfriend through this funk she is in she recently started a new job and was really enjoying it but one day made a couple of minor mistakes and could not handle it and had an anxiety attack she wound up heading to the er and getting a doctor s note that recommended taking a week off she is spent that entire week literally every waking moment on youtube looking up conspiracy theory videos and getting so into them that she now believes sandy hook was a government run farce and we are less than two years out from the next holocaust among many many other clearly mental theories it is painfully obvious to me that she is terrifying herself into psychosis the e r sent her to a gp who prescribed her welbutrin this was only a few days ago so i am hoping as she adjusts to that some of her positivity can come back i told her about 20 minutes ago that i was really getting concerned for her mental health saying that i was not going to argue with her views but that i believed even if we are headed to our doom she had regret not living a happy life while she had the chance she nodded and said i m past the point of being happy the most i can ever be again is content she went on to explain that when she was a child she had a constant feeling of some impending disaster and she now believes that it was divinely sent to her by god previous to this episode we were both agnostic she thinks god is telling her that we are going to be killed by the government and soon and if we do not prepare she started listing things like 432 gallons of water and 40 pounds of enriched pasta we will be dead within two years i have no idea how to bring back the positive sweet wonderful woman i fell in love with last september what can i possibly do i do not believe she is going to hurt herself but she has not said a single positive thing in a while and it is breaking my heart can anyone offer some advice

a few ways to boost your mood that have worked for me

perception it s not just black and white
bear with me it is 4 30 in the morning and i have got no clue how to accurately put this shit into words when i am not sleepy there is these two strange stimuli i get every now and then that just freak me out a little it is really hard to describe but it feels like some half remembered memory they are just random sensory bits that i will just suddenly feel every now and then it is weird though because i can imagine the sensations right now but that does not freak me out but rarely like once or twice a year something will trigger it in my mind and i will be able to recreate it in my mind much more vividly it just randomly hits me and i feel this weird sort of dread like i do not want to know where the hell this stimulus is from i apologize for how vague and weird this sounds i am at just as much of a loss as you commenters probably are but it has not hit me in like six months so i am not going to describe it exactly as it feels right so the sensations themselves there is two first one imagine a makeup removal sponge no seriously it is some object in that shape and size but thicker more cubic harder and more gummy like in how it looks that but with a strange smell like a plastic y smell when it hits me it just makes me nauseous one time during a bus ride it suddenly hit me and i felt like i was going to puke i asked the bus driver if i could open the window for fresh air and he would not let me i got through the drive just fine though it was still really weird i think what started it on the bus was part of my shoes i was sitting with one leg on my knee and part of that shoe was this opaque orange ish thing with a plastic y shoe smell second one this is less a physical object as far as i know and more of a movement i guess i really cannot describe this one accurately without having it hit me but basically try moving just your big toe and none of your other toes make the movement quick and snappy too if that is too difficult try your thumb but it is a lot shorter of a movement if that makes sense whatever it is it is about the size of my big toe but it feels like it is a quicker snappier movement as if what is being moved is shorter than the toe itself i am sorry i cannot really describe this one well has anyone heard of something like this before part of me wants to figure out what this is but there is always this weird sort of dread when it comes to these sensations like i do not want to know what it was are they some kind of repressed memories of some kind of traumatic event i cannot recall any major traumatic event i have had though so the fuck is it
weird vague half remembered stimuli that freaks me out what is it

breakthestigma
since i was a kid i often fantasise day dream that i have achieved everything in my profession or that i am a famous oscar winner or that i have won the booker prize or have become famous otherwise i know these to be fantasies day dream and often purposely enter them as i get a lot of pleasure is this normal i have been doing this since childhood
does anyone fantasise daydream that they are someone famous while knowing this to be a fantasy is this normal
i will try not to ramble on i am middle aged wheelchair bound with a laundry list of physical and mental problems due to a childhood filled with physical and mental abuse and years of hard living and hard drinking to try and forget i managed for years to keep myself together and became a successful executive in my chosen profession but ultimately crashed and burned from too much booze i ended up meeting a wonderful woman when at the end of my rope and she for reasons that will forever be a mystery to me saw something in me and convinced me to get help fast forward and after some initial problems and adjustments i was doing well on antidepressives and antipsychotics and life seemed better than ever now my wife has passed away due to a sudden illness and my daughter and son technically stepchildren but i never made the distinction moved back in to help out but the psychotic breaks panic attacks and sudden overwhelming feelings of helplessness are back i am wondering if my meds need to be changed or i am getting worse any thoughts will be read and appreciated

as someone with a history of mental illness it angers me to no end that the there exists legislature for my condition and only my condition that forces treatment on people like me if someone has kindey failure they can refuse dialysis effectively committing suicide and the court cannot order then to comply if someone is diagnosed with cancer they can refuse surgery and chemo sealing their and discuss that fully with their doctor what would happen and no one bats an eye but if i a mental health patient decide to discuss the option of suicide with my therapist or doctor i have to worry about being forced into court ordered treatment locked away in a hospital until someone who barely knows me thinks i am not going to harm myself where i lose basic human dignities and rights i lose the right to come and go bars are in all the windows like i am a criminal if i refuse to take my medication they can keep me there longer i cannot have shoes with laces i cannot choose when i eat or who sleeps in my bedroom why do some consider it noble to refuse treatment for physcial ailments but not mental ailments it is not a measure of support or will it is a measure of losing to a disease this week i will be making an advanced health care directive stating should i relaspe into severe mental illness again that i will forever retain my fundamental right as a human to refuse any an all treatment medical decisions should be based upon what the individual wants not whar a society deems to be best for the individual and what i want most is my dignity and autonomy i want should i lose this battle to be able to be around my loved ones and to get to say goodbye to everyone and where no one is afraid they will go to jail because they let me do it i wanr not hidden away in the dark alone if i lose i dont want someone to find my body i do not want anyone to ever wonder could i have done more i want to keep the same basic rights given to every person

i just got banned from a forum website for claiming that i ve been seeing a psychologist and for exhibiting mental issues this is by all means a voilation of humans right that is not only the right of speech but also the right as an individual who is been suffering in the dark i am abominated and distraught by the treatment received online tom s hardware is disgusting i did not in fact do anything that voilated their rules let alone using abusive language the closest that i have come to using profanity is the phrase screwed up it is also worth to note that i explicitly stated that i wrote this for peace of mind and recommendation from a psychologist which resulted in my ban the perceive this to be unacceptable for their standard in this sense their terms and conditions should be rescinded

i always knew something was wrong with her both my dad and i but never tried to seek some help i do not know why we always knew she was a dog that barks but never bites so we kind of coped with it but few days ago she said something that disturbed me i got you on this world and i can take you out of it i know i had never thought that way of her or anyone else in my family and i also know that that is not a way to treat a son does anyone have an advice about what should we do or what should we not do any advice is appreciated
my mother s weird statement
i mean i admire their compassion but why why is that when i feel absolutely rotten on the inside and absolutely dead moreover i feel actually i know that i am finding myself resentful of those who take responsibility for their actions and want a genuine change for their lives probably because this is the complete antithesis of my own character and have no desire to change to live and perhaps to flourish in life in fact it puts a smile on my face when i see unrepentant people including those who refuse to take responsibility it shows they have a flaw just like me people who are the opposite of this are a constant reminder of my fundamentally flawed character spirit psyche so having admitted that do i still deserve happiness

what it is like to be a mental health statistic in the church
as the subject says i cannot stop thinking from the moment i wake up to the moment i sleep i have incessant mind chatter and constantly creating a strategy for everything even when having casual conversations with people i have to think of the best way to say what i feel and the probable reaction to what i say for the first 7 years of my life as a child i had vivid nightmares almost every night i always had a wild imagination my thoughts often merge from one subject matter to the next and become more and more extreme and irrational i often hide my feelings from people and because of this i have been told i am a cold and detached person i ve always been a deep thinker since i was a child i have been told i have always been a bright and intelligent person but it seems like the down side of this is that i tend to analyze everything sometimes my brain just goes into overdrive mode and do stuff without thinking and while i am doing my daily activities i think of other complex things in my life this probably came from my aunt because she always told me to think carefully everytime i am talking or even doing something but my thinking always goes a drift to other topics some of my peers might say i am a genius but some might see me as retarded hmmmmmm i cant stand this thing anymore maybe i am adhd mmaybe going crazy

hey currently i am not doing any kind of sports or fitness i am not big or unsporting or anything really that would restrict me from something the thing is i am not very motivated to for example workout sometimes i am but that feeling fades in a matter of days previously i have played tennis and golf although i enjoyed both of those i had some issues tennis was actually pretty fun the only thing bugging me was that after some time there did not seem to be anything new to it it also did not help that i did not really like my coach and mates golf was also fun but it was not demanding enough physically mentally is a whole other story i also like to skate but since it gets really cold in winter i cannot really do that at the moment and i am also not that good at it i have researched a bit which sports i could play but i cannot seem to find one that really fascinates me or rather that i can fascinate myself to start doing if i think about what i really enjoy to do it would be sprinting i am quite quick but i do not have much endurance this is a bit information on my physique height 178cm weight 58kg age 16 not especially strong nor weak as i mentioned quick but on the cost of endurance i would be glad to give you more details if i missed something important and i do not know whether that makes a difference but i play piano so if you have any advice on which sport or activity would suit me please let me know i would really appreciate it thank you in advance
i need help finding a sport that suits me help would be much appreciated

i will admit first and foremost that baseball and football rank much higher in my book that basketball that being said i used to really enjoy watching nba and college basketball lately and tonight s game was no exception it gets harder and harder to watch the game has become entirely about fouls and officiating after every missed shot someone complains openly to a referee about getting fouled the refs have become so trigger happy that any type of contact gets called regardless of how hard of contact it was or if it actually hindered the shooter on top of that there are players dwyane wade is by far the worst that react after every shot whether it goes in or not like they got fouled there are times that i am convinced wade drives the lane and jumps in the air wildly without the intent of actually making a shot but rather getting to the line it just seems like the players would rather take a shot that is more likely to get a foul called than take a higher percentage shot

alex rodriguez jayson werth edit i am not really trying to beat up a rod enough people have done that already for years my major point is to highlight how amazing jayson werth s postseason and season have been in comparison this man deserves his due edit 2 ok originally i did not hate on a rod i was just trying to up the love for j werth but after hearing the ridiculous lovefest for a rod i am calling him out he is undoubtedly a great performer his statistics show this for years but he did at some point make the choice to use performance enhancing substances he constantly cheated on his wife he repeatedly was an ass to teams bailed on umiami at the last moment left the mariners just bc of outrageous sums of money and then demanded that the rangers trade him some people still value character and integrity in athletes and he is utterly lacking in these attributes
alex rodriguez overhyped full of steroids and paid 33 million is playing at the level he should be this playoffs jayson werth on the other hand is playing at the same amazing level but for only 2 5 million

so there i was getting ready to go out for my birthday and after smoking a bowl with 3 of my close friends we finish our drinks and head out by the time we get to our first stop i am feeling weird i thought maybe i had drank too much too fast the lack of sleep from the roadtrip the day before the good weed or a combination of the 3 we sit at the bar and then my reality quite literally shatters all of a sudden it is 3 hours later and we are at the bar i had booked my party at i was terrified at the sheer volume of people and had complete sensory overload i thought my nose was bleeding and that i was covered in blood i did not know where anyone was i did not know what was happening and thought i was going insane autopilot kicked into gear and i found myself at home in tears not knowing what to do i guess the experience in and of itself is not too pertinent but i feel very wronged and very hurt both friends knew i hated hallucinogens but i slipped me two tabs in my beer while i was getting ready i am having a hard time putting into words how i feel the total destruction of trust the inherent malice and ignorance behind it the callous cruelty behind doing that to someone especially a friend and what i did to deserve it for lack of a better term i feel like my mind has been raped my parents want me to press charges but i do not know what that will accomplish both friends along with the rest of our circle so how distraught and terrified i was and apologized profusely saying they had no idea i had react like that but at the same time how fucking stupid does someone have to be to dose their friend with high powered lsd and cut them loose in a 600 person club tl dr i had my self respect dignity trust in my friends and my birthday stolen from me after getting drugged against my will and knowledge by 2 close friends and now i am feeling very shattered ps this is not a pity plea i have never felt this violated before and i do not know what to do anyone else had this happen to them and how did you deal with it edit i have done boatloads of drugs before including acid and good things have never come from hallucinogens i cannot handle the head trip and succumb to sensory overload which is why i do not do them i told these two that i was not down and they dosed me anyway the breach of trust is huge i cannot look at them without feeling very upset and angry i got so fucking high that i could not even process basic questions i pretty much felt like frank from it is always sunny when he is trapped in the garbage can on acid but not funny at all i know they did not mean any harm but we have talked previously how shitty and deep it is to do that to someone it is a move one would pull on someone they really disliked i do not feel comfortable being around them even though they apparently meant well it is shitty because i cannot trust them to look out for me deep down i slept everything off but still feel fucked update doing shitty things in the past justifies having shitty things done to you hm you are right reddit i have not lead the most virtuous of lives that being said i did not need that to happen to me it seems a bunch of you are using the house story as your main argument against me let me clarify that situation i lived in the house everything was fine and i let a friend move in that started to destroy it i lasted 3 weeks before moving out and what they ended up doing to that house afterwards had nothing to do with me at the time of the posting i was simply watching them be idiots and thought it appropriate to post the story in that thread but apparently the powers of assumption have twisted that into my sole responsibility because i was the one that got handed the eviction notice even though i did not even live there at the time stick to the topic at hand i asked what the best course of action was if anyone else had gone through this kind of thing and how they handled it i did not ask for a character decoration because trust me i know i am not a shining example of a human being in fact i am painfully aware of it which is why getting dosed was so terrifying i have been a good friend to those dudes i was always there for them and bent over backwards when i could granted i am a sketchy dude but fucking with someone s mind for shits and giggles no matter how good the intention is a dangerous game and no one deserves it yes years ago i gave a friend a minor dose of mdma so he would get out of his shell and have fun for once instead of being cloistered and awkward that shit is not the same as lsd and those who know know that i am not saying it was the right thing to do in retrospect it was shitty but he did not have a meltdown i did not give him excessive amounts to fuck with him and everything turned out awesome because i stuck by his side and made sure nothing bad happened he also knows about what happened now and periodically indulges in m when he wants to party and while he wishes that i would have told him he does not hold it against me and said i should forgive the lads for their trespasses as it simply just was a fucking mistake that is entirely different than having one s vision suddenly fractal and not know why and having all one s demons rear their ugly heads over heavy bass yeah i do need to clean my life up i have been trying to which is why i moved out of the destroyed house in the first place while taking steps to get the fuck back to school i thought i had a better perception of my friend s characters and while they are deeply apologetic there will always be that thorn
my friends drugged me with acid on my birthday without telling me and i had a very public meltdown in the bar i am feeling very violated it was terrifying and i do not know what to do
i rent an apartment with a friend at night i can sometimes hear her breathing heavily and masturbating not through the room but the walls for some reason sound travels easily through these walls i noticed it when i lay in bed one night and leaned the side of my head to the wall making my ear sit right next to the wall she is kind of shy and reserved i of course have to masturbate as well when i hear her doing it since it is so incredibly hot what i have been thinking about is kind of just walking in on her with a bulging boner asking her if she needs help that or maybe just telling her how hot it is i do not know not sure what the results are going to be though edit i decided to walk in on her it went okay
i hear my house mate masturbating should i walk in on her

for everyone s sake replace anyone in the op title with everyone sorry guys i will not be replying to this post anymore if i see someone with an opinion i have not seen yet i will respond but i am starting to feel like a broken record and i have studying to do thanks major edit here s the deal i have no idea about how it feels to live in a society with guns being normal my apparent ignorance is probably due to the fact that surprise surprise i am in fact ignorant i did not post this to circlejerk i posted this because i did not understand i am seriously disappointed reddit i used to think you were open minded and could handle one person stating their opinion even if it was clearly an ignorant one next time you ask if we australians ride kangaroos to school i will respond with a hearty fuck you faggot you are an idiot rather than a friendly response treat others as you would have others treat you edit 1 i have made a huge mistake edit 2 here are a few of the reason s that have been posted that i found interesting no bans on guns have been put in place because they would not do anything if they were i disagree americans were allowed guns as per the second amendment so that they could protect themselves from the government lolwut all this achieves is make cops fear for their lives constantly its breaching on your freedom this is fair enough to some degree though hypocritical since why then do you not protest the fact that you cannot own nuclear weapons for instance edit 3 my favourite response so far i hope a nigger beats the shit out of you and robs you of all your money then you will wish you had a gun to protect you i would not wish i had a gun i would wish the dark skinned gentleman was not such an asshole edit 4 i must apologise to everyone who expected me to respond to them i have the day off tomorrow and i will respond to a few people but bear with me i have over 9000 comments to go through most of which are pretty damn abusive it seems i have hit a bit of a sore spot  edit 5 if there is one thing i will never forget from this conversation it is this i will feel much safer tucked up here in australia with all the spiders and a bunch of snakes than in america i give myself much higher chances of hiding from reddit s death threats here than hiding behind some ironsights in the us goodnight and see you in the morning some answers to common questions how do you ban guns without causing revolution you phase them out just like we have done in australia with cigarettes first you ban them from public places conceal and carry or whatever then you create a big gun tax then you stop them from being advertised in public then you crank out some very strict licensing laws to do with training then you are pretty much set only people with clean records a good reason and good training would be able to buy new ones they could be phased out over a period of 10 15 years without too much trouble imo i have just read some things about gun shows in america from replies in this thread i think they are actually the main problem as they seem to circumnavigate many laws about gun distribution perhaps enforcing proper laws at gun shows is the way to go then r circlejerk is that way i honestly did not mean to word the question so badly it was late i was tired i had a strong opinion on the matter i think its the its our right to own firearms argument which i like the least at this point also the self defence argument to a lesser degree but what about hunters i do not even slightly mind people who use guns for hunting or competition shooting while i do not hunt would not bolt action 22s suit most situations they are relatively safe in terms of people stopping power more likely to incapacitate than to kill why do you hate americans so well to start with i do not hate americans as for why am i so hostile when i respond its shit like this this is why i posted the original post let me preface this by saying i am ignorant of american society while i assumed that was obvious by my opening sentence apparently i was wrong i figured it was obvious to everyone that guns cause problems every time there has been a school shooting it would not have happened if guns did not exist therefore they cause problems i am not saying all guns cause problems and i am not saying guns are the only cause of those problems its just that to assume something like a gun is a saint and can only do good things i think that is unreasonable therefore i figured everyone thought guns cause at least minor problems what i wanted was people who were pro guns to explain why they were pro guns i did not know why people would be pro guns i thought that it was stupid to have so many guns in society hence i think that allowing everyone to own guns is stupid i wanted people to convince me i wanted to be proven wrong and i used provocative wording because i expected people to take actually take notice and speak up for their beliefs
i am an australian i think that allowing anyone to own guns is stupid reddit why do so many americans think otherwise
i talked about reddit being down and then gave some money to a global giving campaign help equip a rural kenyan library with a computer
we are back what did you do during the great outage of autumn 2012
i always thought i was a forever alone kind of guy even though i had been in love with this girl for like a year and a half in the friend zone of course her douchebag boyfriend dumped her in november and of course i was there to comfort her then i somehow convinced her to go out on a date with me things have been steadily progressing over the course of several weeks until nye when we had sex for the first time we have had sex a couple times since then and therein lies my problem her pussy smells like cool ranch doritos the first time i thought it was a one off but it is happened every time since then i know it sounds pretty implausible maybe even slightly humorous but it is a serious problem i want to give her my best but i just cannot because every time i catch a whiff i get distracted i am finally having sex with the girl i love and all i can think about is cool ranch doritos what do i do edit please do not put this on the front page she is a redditor and she had kill me if she knows i posted this
problem with new girlfriend reddit please help me
tl dr of the comments redditors once again blame rich people for all the worlds problems
even after all the tax breaks the top 5 of earners in this country pay 58 of all taxes in america while the bottom 50 pay less than 2 of all taxes how is making the rich pay more justifiable when they already pay almost all of the taxes
i do not understand why my being a believer instantly makes me a bad person or ignorant or gullible etc but on reddit that seems to be the idea of the vocal majority do i understand there are some ridiculous things that religion asks me to believe yes do i believe everything i am told absolutely not blind faith is dangerous am i a man of science you betcha can i reconcile those seemingly contrasting beliefs i do evolution check big bang most probable young earth creation hahahaha not in a million years i know there are people like me and i know there are many non believers that are good and intelligent people and there are douchey believers and non believers alike i also know i am not perfect i think mormons were hoodwinked by smith and scientology is a quack slightly hypocritical i know but i have no issues with agnostics or jews or muslims or buddhists they believe what they believe and we are cool i find atheists edit gnostic atheists amusing since it takes the same amount of belief to say god does not exist as it takes to say he does but i do not hate those different from me i do not mercilessly mock them for being different at most i might shake my head and walk away or if pushed maybe we progress to a reasonable debate but i honestly want to know reddit why cannot we be friends disclaimer raised protestant have attended catholic mass frequently throughout my life and fairly progressive on social issues i do not attend church regularly and i am not entirely fond of organized religion religion should be there to help people discover their own truths i am an engineer well read and have a general understanding of non christian religions i know everyone is not like i described above but it does seem to be the prevalent school of thought thanks for reading this far tl dr why does reddit hate religious people edit i enjoy the debate and reasoning that is going on here guys it is refreshing hell i even enjoy some of the name calling at least to the ability to quietly chuckle at it i want you to know that i will read through all of this though it may take me some time i am taking the things you say and thinking them over i am reading the links you are posting i may even read dawkins if given the time please continue posting for i truly am glad to be able to read through this
reddit why do you hate me for believing in god

i introduced reddit to my girlfriend she loves it i want to surprise her when we get home tonight and reddit together
i am a girl that is a junior in high school and i have been bullied by other kids pretty much my whole life i read things online about atheist students being bullied and i do not doubt it but honestly i have never seen it most of the kids i go to school with are athiests some go to church because their parents force them to but they do not actually believe in god let alone christianity that is all well and good because we should all be free to worship or not worship according to our own values and beliefs but i am tired of being bullied by athiests at lunch i sit alone i do not have any friends and say a prayer before eating everyday i do not say anything out loud i just put my hands together and thank christ with my thoughts the other day this guy who is an athiest actually came over and pushed my tray to the floor and said tell your god to clean that up and all of his friends laughed i go through this kind of thing every day when i am on the bus i will read my bible and mind my own business and other kids will throw things at the back of my head call me jesus freak etc i tried to make friends but everyone hates me because i am not ashamed of my faith i do not bother anyone and i believe people should have the right to do as they wish as long as they are not interferring with anyone else s rights gay guys have bullied me too calling me hitler and all sorts of hateful things just because i read my bible what they never bothered to find out about me is that i actually support gay marriage i personally do not agree with homosexuality but i believe this is a free country and that religion should not have anything to do with the law i am overall a peaceful person what can i do to make everyone stop hating me i will not give up my religion or prayer edit someone in this thread asked me to describe a typical time i have been bullied and i said the following i am posting it here in case anyone else would like to know in the original post when i talked about the guy that knocked over my tray and said what he did while his friends laughed i did not say anything i just picked up my tray cleaned the food up from the table and went to the bathroom and cried in the stall the other day in class the teacher left for a meeting or something and a guy hit me on the back of the head with a book really hard and said that he is going to torture me until i stop acting like a jesus freak my entire face was red and most of the other kids just laughed although a few of them looked concerned and told him that he went too far the teacher never found out i never say anything about my religion so it is not like i am trying to force my opinions on them i am just tired of them hating me and treating me this way because i am not an atheist edit 2 thanks so much to those of you who care and are giving me advice no matter what you label yourself as you are good people and i am happy to have come across you
i am in a very awkward position and i know most redditors will hate me for existing let alone saying this but i am being bullied at school because i am a christian what can i do to cope with this
hi reddit my wife was an avid redditor for what i believe to be at least a good four years maybe a little more or less i do not think she ever made an account but i do not know for sure there was nothing signed in and nothing in the browser s history so yeah i m uh not exactly even sure why i am posting this maybe it is because she was so avid about this site that i feel like i should tell you what happened i do not want to talk too much about this but i will get it all out in one post just one then i leave i was diagnosed with cancer at the age of thirteen my twenty fourth birthday was two days ago my wife was diagnosed with cancer last year she died two days ago it s hard to think that i have survived quite this long while she was not even given that much of a chance but regardless the fact of the matter is that i need to talk to someone i can t though all of the people who knew us are too distraught over her death she was the social expert i handed all the backstage stuff so to speak and no one can offer a shoulder for me her husband well widow now it is hard reddit i cannot think about anything except her everywhere i look i see things that remind me of her i need to talk to someone but i can t so i am going to say it all here i gave her that cancer reddit i do not know how but i know that i had to have there is no reason for her to have spontaneously gotten cancer last year and me miraculously start getting better at the same time this is all my fault i do not want to kill myself but i feel like i owe her my life this is not fair reddit i need help i said i am only posting once and i am but i will read the comments i might reply to them that does not count as posting right i do not think so what should i do reddit
just one post then i go

redditors that were deaf but can now hear what language did you think in and do you think in your verbal language today

ladies what non sexual thing can make you want to bang a guy

happy yam day here is an album of yam memes to celebrate
i am glad people are giving money to good causes but i am beginning to think that the whole upvote and ill donate trend is just a bunch of lonely people trying to seek validation through karma if you have the money donate what you can and stfu about it edit let me clarify i think that charity should come from the heart with nothing expected in return yes karma is free and it does not hurt anyone to give out copious amounts of it however i feel like this whole trend belittles the entire idea of charity by turning it into some silly little game there is such thing as doing the right thing for the wrong reason and to address the whole it brings awareness argument it brings awareness to what how awesome r atheism is or that it is possible to donate to charity wow i never knew it gets people involved involved in what clicking an arrow if you want to get involved there are better ways what have you donated op complete non sequitur this whole thing reminds me of the rich guy who donates to an institution to get his name on the building as advertising for his business i am happy to see money go to these charity s but this whole fad is completely unnecessary
why let the number of upvotes determine the amount of money you donate to charity why not just donate what you can instead of whoring imaginary internet points
a family member posted this on facebook earlier and it made me wonder i know it is just a light hearted fb post but if i posted that women should be barefoot and making me sandwiches all day i had probably receive a lot of flak is it because historically women have been treated unfairly so now they can get away with this in my opinion this type of mentality is a real problem nowadays and making light of it makes things worse if your relationship truly feels this way you are both doing something wrong
why is it considered ok for women to perpetuate the the wife is always right the husband is always wrong mentality so openly and publicly while male chauvinism is considered despicable disgusting
i have absolutely nothing against homosexuals i have gay friends and family believe homosexuals should be able to marry and do not harbor any ill will toward people who are homosexual however i do not understand why it is or can be considered normal or not an illness the natural state of human must be heterosexual as it enables reproduction our only purpose pretty much everything that we are and how our bodies are designed is for eating and intercourse propogation of the species as it is for all species if it is not a choice if it is predetermined how is that not a mental disorder how is it normal if you buck the design and purpose of your existence again i mean no disrespect and i am sorry if i offended anyone i just do not understand and i want to
i mean no disrespect but can someone explain to me why how being homosexual is not an illness
she left me for a different guy i do not feel i did anything wrong edit i was hoping for more funny stories but ok edit no i dont care about fake internet points she was doing something stupid she thought would annoy me i was hoping you would all have some similar petty stories of spite
my ex is using multiple accounts to downvote my posts after a bitter breakup what spiteful crap have people pulled on you lately
today she texted me essentially saying that i am obligated to her not to spread this because it is no one else business i see what she is saying but at the same time i would not feel right lying to people who care enough to ask me why i broke up with her for the sake of protecting her after what she did repeatedly so what i am asking is whether honest as the moral thing is the right path or telling a small lie for the sake of her happiness is right thanks
my girlfriend cheated on me and when people ask why i broke up with her i tell them is that wrong vindictive of me
because the new queue is becoming overwhelmed with nearly identical questions about your experiences with september 11 2001 a megathread looks necessary pretty much all 9 11 posts should go here for the time being if you have a question as to whether yours is unique enough to warrant its own post check with the mods consider each top level comment a new thread to ask a question respond to that comment as you would respond to it if it were a thread  it is tagged as serious non serious offensive or otherwise inappropriate content will be removed
serious 9 11 megathread where were you how has it affected you other questions
obviously coming from someone who never has had this happen b4
what does it feel like to get a post on the front page

girls of reddit what are signs that you give off to let a guy know that you are interested
france for me because i have been there a few times and every time i have found the french to be loud and rather annoying that and i do not like wine cheese or most things that come out of france
you are allowed to remove one country from existence without consequence which one would you pick and what is your reason
i read it here after reading it on another reddit and i was thoroughly depressed i always believed in non violence and often told people think of gandhi but this disgusts me and it is not just this site
til gandhi regularly beat his wife and kids his son converted to islam he had a friend in hitler and told the jews to commit a mass suicide what have you learned about a revered leader that blew your mind

a huge black at t pop up keeps on appearing on reddit blocking my view of reddity stuff that is not cool edit this issue has of course been fixed much thanks to the staff of reddit for their extremely quick response d
dear reddit whats with the ads
i have seen a lot of potentially great conversations die off here simply because the initial discussants do not bother to vote it up i guess it might be because they do not want to give people karma but if you enjoyed something enough to comment or even just found it provoking why not give others the same chance just a thought i really like this sub and just thought i had see what people think about this
why do people answer questions in an askreddit thread but not upvote it
methinks all these newbies are a little too enthusiastic and not cynical and bitter like the rest of us
has anyone noticed there are a shit ton of upvotes going around
i do not get it it seems like child exploitation should be the one thing we all agree is wrong now there is a preteen girls subreddit if you look up the definition of child pornography the stuff in this subreddit clearly and unequivocally fits the definition and the free speech argument is completely ridiculous because this is a privately owned website so recently a thread in r wtf r wtf discussed this subreddit and i am completely dumbfounded at how many upvotes were given to people defending that cp subreddit so my main question is what the fuck is it about child pornography that redditors feel so compelled to defend i know different people have different limits on what they consider offensive but come on child pornography it is bad people why the fuck are not the reddit admins shutting down the child exploitation subreddits and i am not interested in any slippery slope arguments first they shut down the cp subreddits then the next step is nazi germany v2 0 edit i just do not understand why there is such frothing at the mouth defense when it comes to cp of all things for the pics of dead babies or beatingwomen subs you hear muted agreement like yeah those are pretty fucked up but when it comes to cp you will hear bombastic exhortations about free speech and voltaire and how nazi germany is the next logical step after you shut down a subreddit edit to all of you free speech whiteknights have you visited that preteen girls subreddit it is a place for people to jack off to extremely underage girls if you are ok with that then so be it i personally think kids should be defended not jacked off to i make no apologies for my views on this matter
why do the reddit admins allow child exploitation subreddits and why do so many redditors defend them under the guise of free speech
most of the posts on r christianity are about philosophy how to deal with life s problems intellectual discussions and supporting one another most of the posts on r atheism are about mocking belittling or otherwise bashing those that do not agree with their outlook on life yet the posts on reddit usually follow the narrative that christians are hateful bigots who exclude atheists while atheists are intellectually superior why is reddit like this
why is reddit like this

former trump supporters of reddit what was the final straw for you
this question is directed to the redditors who are posting pictures of their patients who tried to commit suicide this is a very serious matter and i want to know what is wrong with you i first noticed this on the front page of reddit i left a comment which i will quote below i am sorry but you are a complete asshole for posting this online think for a second picture you are this guy if you just tried to commit suicide by shooting yourself in the head with a nail gun would you really want your doctor or whatever the hell you are posting a picture of it online no you wouldn t i highly doubt he gave you permission to post this online nor did you probably have the balls to ask someone who just tried to kill themselves if you could share it online i know it shows no info about the patient but still it is not appropriate and if your boss found it i guarantee you would be fired on the spot i hate to be the one to say it i am sure almost everyone reading this will disagree with me and down vote this comment but at least i have the balls to say something permalink to my just a few minutes later i scrolled through the comments and noticed someone else commented on the post saying i had a patient try a similar with a link to a pic of the patients injuries it is not funny and i want to know why you think you have the right to share pictures of patients who tried to kill themselves if you are one who did this i want you to read my quote above and think it over i know i sound like a dick but i just want to know why people are doing this it is so disrepectful it is not even funny maybe i just see it this way being that i was in volunteer ems for a few years and now am a volunteer firefighter in training maybe it is just the way i view things being that there are hippa laws and crap but still really edit 1 for the people saying it s an x ray no one will know who it is anyway that is not my point my point is it is completely inappropriate to be posting this kind of content online for the world to see being that these people are doctors or whatever they claim to be it is inappropriate period edit 2 for the people saying it is not illegal it might be illegal it might not be either way i did not say anything about that i said it is inappropriate not it is illegal edit 3 i am not offended i am just stating i think it is wrong whether the doctor posted this or the nurse sent a friend a pic this and the friend posted it both the nurse was wrong for sharing confidential things like this as well as the friend for posting it online as far as the ems fire dept shit goes and my age fuck off you know nothing about how it is where i volunteer you have to be 16 to be a dispatcher 18 to be a medic emt and 18 to be a firefighter i have been volunteering for a few years starting by cleaning around the ems base cleaning the rigs filling the soda machines taking out trash etc worked my way up to dispatch about a year or 2 before i was 16 and have been doing it since you do not know what it is like so shut up maybe my family has been involved for years maybe not you do not know the deal so keep your mouth shut about it it is volunteer they can do what they want do not call it bullshit i take time out of my life to volunteer to save lives fuck off and stop going off topic edit 4 here s a similar example let us say some hacker gets into your computer and sets up a key logger he get s all of your passwords and leaks them to the world on reddit or some other website would you want the world seeing your personal passwords that go to your bank accounts emails etc no it is personal privacy you do not want your personal stuff being shared with the world neither does this guy who tried to kill himself my point is it is not right i am sure you wouldent want it happening either i am looking for reddit s opinions not trolls to starts fights and shit it comments go away if you are looking for trouble edit 5 most people disagree yet some agree those that agree have mostly shared valid points that i may not have said so thank you i have gone into the negatives for down votes but it was worth it i wanted to speak my mind
what is wrong with some of you redditors totally inappropriate

yam what is you favorite movie about if a word of the title is replaced with yam
i could not care less about american health care politics celebrities corruption which covers about 95 of the stories on reddit who is with me edit 1 unless your website filters the entire world out its not an american website 2 i like americans i have some great american friends i just do not give a crap about the current political news 3 i love reddit but in the last year or so i have found it a lot more difficult to find content that i am interested in when i first started it was easy i ignored it during the presidential campaign fair enough guys but now its just annoying 4 i also prefixed my question with wouldn t it be great not aren t americans all assholes if i unsubscribe from say politics would not i miss some interesting australian political stories would i need a subreddit au politics unless it was cross posted to australia then would not we need a subreddit for every country that had politics the question i asked i think was a valid one politics should contain all political stories but it would be nice to filter certain topics or countries of origin thanks to everyone who gave actual suggestions p s australia has free healthcare has already seemingly recovered from the financial crisis that apparently originated in america has lobsters the size of your average dog
would not it be great if there was a way to turn off all america related posts in reddit

reddit i love you but i do not get it all of the troll face fuuuuuu me gusta challenge accepted etc stuff is just lame what is the obsession
i just learned i was dying reddit i am 22 and i have no idea how to tell my fiance gf of 8 years about it or my family long story short i broke my neck when i was 9 when i was tackled into a tree at school and severed my c 1 c 2 vertabra in my neck when it broke it sheered an artery in my neck and i had a stroke when part of my cartridge dissected an artery which paralyzed me for two years i had 2 surgeries for that but recently found out the clot is growing and i will go brain dead in the next decade edit i am gonna tell her and my family its not gonna be easy but i am gonna try what do i do ask me anything or offer advice i will be up till the alcohol knocks me out
how do i tell my love ones i am dying
when people have a legal problem everyone tells them to lawyer up but when people have a psychological problem suddenly everyone tells them to get on medication and spend thousands of dollars on expensive therapy instead of simply going to a doctor i have even seen people recommend over the counter medication why what is the difference why not simply tell them to talk to a psychologist guess what you are not a trained professional and even if you were you would not give a diagnostic based on ten lines of text without ever meeting the person in the first place you have got a legal problem you talk to a lawyer you have got a health problem you talk to a doctor more often than not it is a minor problem stress due to exams feeling down due to the season etc what you are doing is borderline dangerous what if a person becomes so convinced she or he has depression that he read up on it and then simulate more symptoms he would no problem tricking a doctor into believing he is really depressed although he might not be in the first place worse the person not willing to talk about it in real life might order some crap on the internet and get serious sick medications are not bad but very few are without consequences sleep problem mood problems allergic reactions it is pointless to take medication if you do not really need it you are not a health expert nor do you have the experience to tell people to take medication your own personal experience is pointless stop trying to play the messiah and let people get help from a real life source thank you a real life psychologist edit yay downvoted i guess reddit likes to keep writing false advices on psychological help threads just do not cry when a person that follows your advice ends up killing himself or maybe that is what you want in the first place
reddit stop trying to play the expert it is dangerous
although it may be in the form of a question it may not be the best subreddit to get information from askreddit is more suited for questions to and about the people in the community not about news and current events
please direct your posts about osama bin laden to a more relevant subreddit like worldnews or worldpolitics
it just feels like everyone s forgotten about it and i do not ever remember hearing about anything they have accomplished i agreed with the message but i do not think anything will be accomplished by camping out in parks and yelling with megaphones

it seems like there was a time where reddit felt like a community for the past few years i have noticed a steady decline to the point where i am ready to leave anything i post immediately gets knocked down and mocked i know we are all wise asses but it is gotten out of control it is just plain mean at this point now before you immediately downvote this and leave a nasty comment think about what i have said
why is everyone a dick on reddit
just curious because i get really infuriated with a lot of people opinions liberal softie hippyesque on reddit even just reading through comments my bane is that i like to kill time looking at dumb useless shit and the occasional semi interesting article
how many of you are here just because you like to look at stupid shit and kill time even though you really hate the mindset of most of reddit
for every cheating girlfriend there is a cheating boyfriend in the world all i see is hate directed towards women here and it has begun to irk me edit2 yes it comes above edit1 say something nice about a woman you know or a generalisation edit1 let us say nice things about men too and not bash them women have a deep sense of loyalty when it comes to to their friends if anyone speaks out or hurts someone they love they will stand up for them men can be like that too men even though feminists will disagree have a need to protect whether it is women puppies or their friends they are also just have better depth perception edit 3 it is not the misogynistic jokes that irk me
why oh why does reddit hate women can someone say something nice about women

the answer is advertising imo i just want people to realize how victim they are to advertising as the hypocrisy has been driving me crazy of late edit1 and so this does not turn into r pcissomuchbetteryoudumbasscirclejerk and r macsrockmysockscirlcejerk conflict i would like to also like to mention how netflix right now is my only hope to stop paying 45 dollars a month for cable and 9 50 for a single movie ticket which is also driving me a bit crazy edit2 just got out a no computer class and went to check on this and it seems to have taken off a bit i am in awe and truly thank you for helping me come to a more educated opinion on the matter as it has shifted some in what i have read so far i am going to attempt to read everyone s comment because you took time writing it and it deserves respect however i do not have time to respond as i have a paper due tonight need to play starcaft which note runs like a 3 legged brontosaurus on a mac compared to a pc edit3 ok there is a lot about comparing products and how the two products are not the same thing and not comparable they are not the same thing right but they are both consumer goods why does mac get to be an inelastic good but netflix and elastic good as far as i see it mac should be inelastic because they do not really do anything that you cannot make your pc do it is just advertising that makes you feel as if they do things that other computers cannot do and is essential for survival in today s world edit4 my bf just looked at this and sighed heavily so those who came here to sigh at me for provoking reddit it is been done for you
why is the 7 dollar increase with netflix reason for pitchforks and cries of enough you greedy capitalist while apple is praised for charging 200 300 dollars more for a product you can get cheaper anywhere else
ok before you downvote me into oblivion at least hear me out i am not a vegetarian or into bestiality but i read a news article about a guy who had sex with one of his cows and he was sent to prison and all his animals were taken away from him under the guise of animal cruelty i found it kind of hypocritical that if he had shot the cow in the head with a bolt gun skinned it cut out its internal organs and ate them no one would even bat an eyelid he could have used a giant rubber dick to forcibly impregnate it so it would lactate and then kill its child to make veil veal and this would not be considered cruelty yet an act that cause neither the animal nor human harm is a felony seems kind of hypocritical in my opinion thoughts
why is it okay to kill a cow but the second you have sex with it it is animal cruelty please read before you downvote

forgive my lack of delicacy but why do white people so often fail to display a sociological imagination mistake anecdotal stories as a systemic reality and fail to recognize the impact of privilege
so basically i just came back from a different country in which i had 3 different girlfriends over the last two years the first of them apparently gave me asymptomatic hpv without me knowing which i then passed on to the second one whom i met a year ago i stayed with her for about 6 months during which we never used condoms because i had been checked for common std s but not hpv and she was on the pill stupidly i thought it was okay now 6 months after we broke up she has developed cervical cancer and according to the doctor she will die within a year without treatment the problem is she cannot afford it she has already had lots of treatment borrowed huge amounts of money from her friends and is in the process of selling her beauty clinic to pay back those loans now it turns out the disease is even more serious than she thought she has no health insurance and her country has zero state aid her family is really poor and she also refuses to tell them about her disease since she has found out the degree of seriousness she has basically accepted her own death she is only 25 years old really hard working beautiful smart and nice she worked from total poverty into having her own business with several employees rather than rely on her looks to get on the hook with some rich man if anyone deserves to die it is not her but she will simply not be able to pay the insane bills for cervical surgery and treatment no matter what she does she cannot get through this alone unfortunately she is not very well connected either being rather antisocial and preferring to just work and stay at home even though we just dated for 6 months i am one of the people who knows her best but currently in a different country i brought this upon her but i am 100 broke myself being a uni student yet i feel i am the only one that both can and want to help her my only option is to take out a huge loan and then send to her i have a line of credit of about 10000 i can use but i do not think that will be enough i am not sure how much money is needed but i am sure it is a lot and it will be over a long time it will be something that i would have to pay back on for the rest of my life but on the other hand if she dies and i did not help her i think i will never be able to live with myself since i was not only responsible for what killed her i was also the only one who could have helped her i found out about her cancer about 2 months ago and just today found out how serious it is i have just been crying all day and i am completely lost on what i should do please give some advice sorry if this is the wrong subreddit i will post this somewhere else if someone can point me to a more fitting one

edit people i am not looking for geniuses in this thread and i am not looking for super achievers i am well aware that high iq does not equal happiness and all of this i am simply interested in the everyday life of very intelligent people i think everyone will agree that 150 is quite above the average and enough to be anything you want in life it does not matter if they dig ditches or build nasa robots for a living i do not give a fuck edit2 til half reddit are semi geniuses

i am genuinely interested in the mindset on this it is not just a jab at americans you see a lot of people mention things wrong or right with their country on reddit without mentioning where they are from or saying the world when people from other countries know it is not true where they come from what is it about america that makes them assume they are the default country edit 1 a lot of great answers but my question can easily refer beyond reddit the world series for example where only americans play and i have seen tv shows where people insist theirs is the biggest best most important in the world when what they really mean is in the usa geographical isolation is the answer i never thought about but makes most sense so thanks to those that brought that point forward edit 2 i did not expect this to get so big and i thank a lot of the users for being serious with the question and answering it honestly i now see from a different perspective the size and scope of america the isolation from cultures as compared to europeans and other things for the other people ignoring the serious tag time to grow up
serious why do americans often talk like they are the default country
i am not trying to be dramatic about it but i just feel out of place anymore every thread seems to be dominated by puns these days and they are usually not even clever almost any link i post is immediately downvoted i could post that i found a cure for cancer and it would get downvoted into oblivion it just seems like the place is dominated by middle school trolls and it is really lost its appeal to me i can deal with differing opinions but i just cannot take all the childish bullshit so my question is are there any alternatives i have been coming here for years so the withdrawals would be pretty severe i feel like a heroin addict that wants to quit but would need methadone to do it edit two downvotes in 6 minutes this is precisely what i am talking about i am asking an honest question nothing offensive or rude in the slightest and i get downvoted sad edit 2 came back to a ton of comments i really do appreciate the input it is been pointed out that i have not really been adding much myself and it is a valid point i have just kind of been in frustrated asshole mode lately that is something i need to work on i was not always like that anyway i am going to check out some of the links you guys provided tis much appreciated edit 3 i just noticed i now have reddit gold if someone here got it for me thanks edit 4 so as this whole thing fades into the sunset i had like to say a couple things a all the naysayers that pointed out my post record are valid without even realizing it i have become part of the problem secondly a lot of good folk have come out of the woodwork i had like to again thank whoever got me the reddit gold and d i am probably not going to leave i was just being dramatic because i had just woke up silly me i did not realize what it had turn in to i appreciate all the comments and i thank you all for them it is honestly renewed my faith in this community so anyway i wish all that read this a good day or night or morning or whatever it may be there no hard feelings
serious question are there any good alternatives to reddit i just do not feel like i fit in anymore
edit this thread got way too out of hand

expecting down votes to hell and back here but almost every aspect of religion which i do not like such as the zealous preaching the high and mighty social stances the we re right no matter what you say attitude and the general in your face everywhere you go ness of it seems to have crept in to atheism of late to the point that i now find it quite hard to distinguish and really do not see the point many people have been turned off from religion because of these factors yet they seem to be creeping in to atheism or perhaps even rife so what do we who do not want to be associated with that side of things regardless of whether we believe in creation or evolution or both now call ourselves edit i do not think i have ever seen a thread so evenly split all the way through it is had almost equal up and down votes
is it just me or is atheism becoming a religion

an odd way to celebrate but the timing was coincidental enough we decided to make the most of it in our subreddit r ideasforaskreddit the moderators take suggestions from the community about what the users would like to see from this subreddit recently this post asking for one week free of sex became wildly popular the most successful suggestion in r ideasforaskreddit so far so by popular demand r askreddit will begin a one week trial of not allowing any questions about sexual topics this trial will begin today the 27th of january and will run for approximately one week the range of sexual topics that will be removed covers porn recommendation posts nsfw or disgusting image posts personal sexual questions and everything in between these questions will be automatically removed by the automoderator based on a number of keywords and redirected to r askredditafterdark the nsfw version of r askreddit but the automoderator is not flawless so if you see a post that you think violates the rule please report the offending post with the week drawing to a close we invite you to share your reflections of it with this in our subreddit r ideasforaskreddit thank you also remember no personal information the sticky may be gone but the rule is not

had an elderly lady recently ask me how much her son s cherry 1963 corvette was worth it was driven only 1000 miles before he went to vietnam and died in the battles she thought it was worth maybe 1500 or 2000 i told her it was much more valuable than that and that she should call a dealer to sell it she did and received a very substantial amount of money in the neighborhood of 70 000 she came to my home and offered me a check for 50 000 i told her there was no way i could take her money it was her s and she should use it to do something to honor her son or something she wanted to do did i do the correct thing was i a fool i know this was something that i had to do i would never have been able to sleep at night had i taken her money but i also could have used it however it was not my car nor my family no way i could have taken the check fool or not

last night i was at an admittedly nice wedding the groom told me that in total the wedding cost over 60 000 now they are both physicians but even 8 years after graduating both are still paying off med school bills they had to finance part of their wedding with credit cards even with their combined income i see spending this much for one day a total waste i asked why the hell he would spend so much and he gave me the answer i usually hear she always wanted a big wedding  most people getting married are just starting out saddling yourself with a huge amount of debt is just stupid stupid stupid edit the groom himself told me he cannot afford this wedding and worried about all the extra shifts they are going to have to do just to pay for it over a year s worth of shifts just to make the costs fit into their already tight budget that is just a stupid way to start off a marriage and financially irresponsible edit since i have the luxury and attention of the front page i will yield some true and apparently unpopular advice it is your wedding day yes it deserves to be special however do not allow it to become a burden on the bigger picture your life together couples fighting about money working extra shifts to get things paid just to pay debt while not spending time together hurts relationships if you are young and just starting out please delay gratification save some money for your own future and dare i say for your future children s future you can buy a car and even a house outright in cash it takes resolve and sacrifice but you can do it to the few who heed this advice good for you i wish all of you getting married the best and hope you all get off to a good start keeping it real redditluv
